<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE.</a></h2>

<p>In the following work on the Educational System
of the Jesuits, I have endeavored to present a critical
statement of the principles and method adopted in the
Society of Jesus. The effort to explain the sources,
process of development, and present influence of the
system within and without the Order, has made of
the first part a biographical and historical sketch, having
for its chief subject the person of the Founder;
while the details and the pedagogical significance of
the various elements in the method appear, in the
second part, as a critical analysis of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>.</p>

<p>The educational literature which treats of this system
is very extensive. Various estimates and conclusions
have been arrived at, on the merits of documents
frequently referred to, for an exposition of the
meaning and philosophy of the system. Hence, with
the view of facilitating a clear and comprehensive
judgment on the subject, I have thought it not inadvisable
to quote accurately from such documents,
omitting none which bore upon the matter, if only
they were within reach. It so happens that, at present,
a large number of the sources, regulations, and
commentaries, heretofore rare and altogether out
of reach, have been rendered easy of access, being
embodied in the great work, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Monumenta Germaniæ
Pædagogica</i>, which is already beyond its tenth volume.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
Three of the volumes so far issued are upon
the Jesuit System; they have been compiled by the
late Rev. G.&nbsp;M. Pachtler, S.&nbsp;J. If the three or four
volumes, which still remain to be issued by the Rev.
Bernard Duhr, S.&nbsp;J., had been available, they too could
have been laid under contribution for examples and
illustrations. But perhaps the theme will appear
sufficiently illustrated as it is.</p>

<p>Besides the original documents, I have used no less
authentic an exponent than that which the maxim
of law approves: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Consuetudo, optima legis interpres</i>,
"Custom, which is the best interpreter of law."</p>

<p>While all that is oldest and most authentic has thus
been made use of in explaining the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>,
the actual condition of pedagogics to-day is new, and
so is the state of the question involved. Hence, to
satisfy the requirements of the present, reference has
been made not exclusively either to the customs or
the learned documents of a former age.</p>

<p>In a word, the object aimed at has been to indicate
the chief traits which are characteristic of the system,
and which may be suggestive in the development
of pedagogical science. Whether such an object has
been attained, so as to meet many questions which
may possibly arise, and to satisfy the desire which
actually exists, it will be for others to decide.</p>

<p>A learned and elegant work, which narrates the
rise and progress of Christian Schools, from the sixtieth
year of the Christian era onwards, ends its long
journey at the date of the Reformation, and takes
leave of its varied subject, and of its lines of Christian
Scholars, in these words: "We leave them at
the moment when the episcopacy was recovering its
ancient jurisdiction over the ecclesiastical seminaries,
and when a vast majority of the secular schools of
Catholic Christendom were passing into the hands of
a great Religious Order, raised up, as it would seem,
with the special design of consolidating anew a system
of Christian <span class="locked">education."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></p>

<p>Two centuries and a half later, when the Society of
Jesus had run a long course, from the date of the
Reformation which had seen it rise, up to the eve of
the Revolution which beheld it extinct, a General of
the Order, Ignatius Visconti, addressing the Provincial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Superiors over the world, takes note of a new stage in
the process of educational development: "The taste
for letters now," he says, "is more keen and exquisite,
and the number of literary schools has increased so
much, that ours may no longer appear so necessary.
For I may mention the fact that, besides our schools
of polite letters, there were, for a long while, either
none or very few. So that parents were forced to
send their children to us, even if otherwise they did
not want <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<p>This refers in a quiet way to what Leopold von
Ranke states with more emphasis. Speaking of
Grammar classes, the German historian says: "Here
also the Jesuits succeeded to admiration. It was
found that young people gained more with them in
six months, than with other teachers in two years.
Even Protestants removed their children from distant
gymnasia to confide them to the care of the
<span class="locked">Jesuits."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> Ranke narrates in the same place how it
was "toward the universities above all that the efforts
of the Jesuits were directed." And he describes what
the results were in Germany.</p>

<p>D'Alembert writes of their progress in France:
"Hardly had the Company of Jesus begun to show
itself in France, than it met with difficulties without
number, in the endeavor to establish itself. The universities
especially made the greatest efforts to keep
the new-comers out. It is difficult to decide whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
this opposition is a praise or a condemnation of the
Jesuits who stood it. They announced gratuitous
teaching; they counted among their number celebrated
and learned men, superior perhaps to those
whom the universities could boast of," <span class="locked">etc.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span></p>

<p>Speaking of the Protestants in the Netherlands,
a chronicle, which reviews the first century of the
Order's existence, records that "the Jesuit schools
were expressly interdicted, under severe penalties, to
all members of the Protestant communities. Even
in a twelve-year truce which the Order partially
enjoyed, a monthly fine of one hundred florins was
still imposed upon all delinquents, or on their parents,
who persisted in patronizing the Jesuit schools.
To escape the fine, parents sent their children under
an assumed <span class="locked">name.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span></p>

<p>In every country, the same drama of struggle and
contest evolved itself through two and a half centuries,
till a momentous scene was witnessed. It was
a scene of such a kind as seldom has occurred in history;
and never certainly was any similar event
thrown into such relief by the sequel. The event
which I refer to was a universal and instantaneous
suppression of the Order; with consequences following
thereupon which were exceptional, both in the world
that witnessed it, and in the subject-body that suffered
it.</p>

<p>The sequel in the world at large was that, a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
years later, at the close of the eighteenth century,
there broke out the great Revolution under the leadership
of men, of whom scarcely one had been more
than seven years of age at the date of the Jesuits'
<span class="locked">expulsion.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> They represented in France the first generation
which had not been educated by the Society.
The remote causes which overwhelmed the Order were
the same that ushered in the Revolution. But, among
the immediate causes, assigned by historians to account
for the precise form which the great convulsion
assumed, and for the date at which it occurred, is
placed the dissolution of this Order. According to
the Count de Maistre, who speaks of the political
sentiment of his own times, all observers agreed that
the revolution of Europe, still called the French
Revolution, was impossible without the preliminary
destruction of the Jesuits. And, in keeping with this,
it was equally a subject of observation, as being a
palpable historical fact, that during two centuries the
Jesuits had formed in their College at Paris, the élite
of the French nobility; and that, only a few years
after the expulsion of the Jesuit Masters, the same college
turned out the Robespierres, Camille Desmoulins,
Tallien, Noël, Fréron, Chénier, and other such demagogues.
This College of Clermont, or Louis-le-Grand,
from which the Jesuits were expelled in 1762, had
been immediately occupied by the University of
Paris. The Revolution broke out twenty-seven years
later.</p>

<p>Another sequel, not heard of before in history,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
affected the Society itself. Europe, having gone
through the violent commotions which changed the
old order of things into the new, reached the beginning
of this nineteenth century, and found the Society
alive again. This was in defiance of a political
maxim, which we may admit with Baron von Hübner,
that in politics, in the affairs of states, in the life of
all great social institutions, when once death supervenes,
there is no resurrection.</p>

<p>And now, at the end of the nineteenth century, the
same forces of repulsion and attraction, of devoted
love on the part of friends, of intense hatred on the
part of enemies, have been seen operating as always
before. It has become a commonplace in the philosophy
of history,&mdash;this hatred which has been sworn
against the Order of Jesus, and the multitude of enemies
whom it has made. One explanation suggests
itself to the Viscount de Bonald,&mdash;the presence in
it, he thinks, of something good; of that good which,
as it alone is the object of the most ardent love,
can alone become the object of the intensest hate;
and therefore has always made persecutors and martyrs.</p>

<p>The purpose of this book is to give an historical
sketch, with a proportionate analysis, of the educational
development effected through the Society of
Jesus. Others have taken different fields of Jesuit
history to survey, either general and comprehending
all the paths of external and internal activity, or particular
and comprising only parts of the history. Some
of these particular views, especially in later years, are
in the line of studies, and are most valuable contributions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
to the history of pedagogic development. None
of them, however, happens to coincide with the scope,
purpose, and form which have been designated for
this; as the Series to which it belongs, the Editor in
charge, and the country for which it is intended, sufficiently
indicate.</p>

<p>The subject then is the educational system of the
Jesuits, that system which technically is called the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>. It requires no literary nor historical
ingenuity to centre all that has to be said about
it in the personality and character of St. Ignatius of
Loyola. I shall draw upon Jesuit sources of information,
except when it will be necessary to state results,
or give estimates, which imply commendation. Then
I shall quote freely from sources outside of the Order.
Otherwise, for the purpose of explaining and analyzing
domestic matters, these extraneous references
would be imperfect indeed.</p>

<p>The situation, which met the military view of the
cavalier, lately the knightly captain of Loyola, was
a new one, on an old field of battle. The demand, which
it seemed to make upon tactical resources, was as
intense as the political and religious crisis which
created the situation. From the year 1522 till 1540,
while Ignatius was prospecting the scene in Europe,
and preparing to take an active part in it, he had time
and the opportunities for observing, what precisely,
at that epoch, were the accumulated results of all the
Christian ages gone before; and why the results just
then were only what they were. The issue appeared
fatally determined by social conditions around, which
more than neutralized the Christianity visible. Education,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
in particular, was laboring under the action of
causes, which had begun to operate several centuries
earlier, and which were then evidently working themselves
out to one final effort. That was the undermining
of Christian education.</p>

<p>In this respect, it was the same question which had
confronted the Augustines, the Basils, and Jeromes,
of one thousand years before. But it was a different
state of the question. Augustine, the brilliant youth
of Hippo Regius in Africa, will serve as an instance
of what the issue then had been. He had made himself
master of the very best results, which the public
schools of the time were able to accomplish in the
most gifted of minds. But he had lost his virtue.
He lived to complain with bitterness, that it was
accounted a grievous error to pronounce <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">homo</i> "a
man," without the "h," but it was no error at all to
hate a man, signified by the word, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">homo</i>. The consequence
with him was that, when he became a Bishop
of the Church, he met the need of providing a Christian
education, by instituting in his own house a kind
of school, for the moral and spiritual education of his
clergy.</p>

<p>Thus arose the cathedral or canonical school. So
too, the cloistral schools came to flourish in the abbeys
and the monasteries. And, even if these two kinds
of educational centres had not also been, as they
really were, in the Middle Ages, the preordained means
for the salvation of learning in Europe, they would
still have had reason enough for their existence, in
the paramount necessity of continuing, for the tender
age of youth, the ministry of a virtuous education.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Events took a new turn with the rise and progress
of the university system. At first, the universities
were mostly annexed to cathedral churches. As they
developed, the cloistral influence waned. And again,
as they developed still more, they presented phenomena
which originated the subsequent system of
the Jesuits.</p>

<p>From the twelfth to the sixteenth centuries, as
many as sixty-six of these universities were in existence;
sixteen of them are credited to Germany; about
as many to France; and the rest to Italy, Spain,
and other nations. It is not within my province to
describe their formation, or the order of their foundation.
They received their charters from the Popes,
who used their power thus, and showed it under a
form, which no age will be apt to depreciate; least of
all, our own. Addressing these habitations of "General
Studies" with the appellative, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Universitas Vestra</i>,
the Sovereign Pontiffs sent them on their course, and
encouraged them in every line of Theology, Law, or
Medicine; whether all these lines were followed in
each centre, or respectively some here, some there.
Orleans, Bourges, Bologna, Modena professed Law,
either as their specialty, or as their distinguishing
faculty; Montpellier, Salerno, Medicine; Padua, the
Liberal Arts; Toledo, Mathematics; Salamanca, and,
above all, Paris, general culture, Philosophy, and
Theology.</p>

<p>These universities became such well-springs of learning,
that for Theology the Bishops' seminaries practically
ceased to exist; and, to acquire the general
culture of the times, the children of the faithful no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
longer turned to the monastic schools. Nay, in quite
a contrary sense, the clergy and the monks themselves,
in pursuit of the best learning that the age
could give, left their cloisters for a while, and betook
themselves to the universities. They followed up
that step by settling down there. Paris beheld the
great old orders of Augustinians, Benedictines, Carthusians,
the Carmelites, the Bernardines, all establishing
monasteries or colleges; no otherwise than the
newest order of Trinitarians, which was chiefly made
up of university men. Two institutes arose, those of
the Dominicans and Franciscans; who with men at
their head, like St. Thomas Aquinas and St. Bonaventure,
placed themselves right in the heart of these
intellectual centres; and they became bulwarks of
sound learning, as opposed to the inanities of a false
scholasticism. They kept the leaven of religion and
virtue in the midst of what was not quite a perverse
generation, but was most certainly, from whatever
side we view it, a very dubious multitude, belonging,
it is true, to a Christian generation. Consider the
10,000 at Bologna, which was the centre for Law
studies; the 30,000 at Oxford; or the 40,000, all at one
time studying, or reckoned to be studying, in Paris, the
acknowledged centre for Theology.</p>

<p>An indiscriminate mass of humanity like this,
pressed, thronged, and crowded together, stimulated
with all the ardor, and alive with all the passions of
youth, could not fail to be little better than a nursery
for indiscriminate license. Whatever might be the
vigilance of the Church, or however strenuous the
exercise of legitimate authority, nothing in the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
course of human society could prevent its becoming
a prolific soil for the propagation of every species of
error. And, as during three hundred years the intellectual
and educational powers of Europe followed
this course, the law of evolution asserted itself in
many directions.</p>

<p>On the one side, those tens of thousands of Christian
youths, who were aiming at all the posts of influence
in Church and State, and who, entering their
native university, or journeying to foreign ones, began
life there at as early an age as twelve or fourteen
years, to remain in this environment some nine or
twelve years more, became, as was natural, the living,
swarming members of a state of society so dissolute,
that successive occupants of the Papal See depicted
the condition of things as one of moral contagion.
In the manner of thought and mind which prevailed,
no form of theoretic error was wanting. In philosophy,
there was scepticism; in theology, heresy; while,
in politics, Cæsarism and absolutism became rife.
Then, at the end of the fifteenth century, the Renaissance
came; and one of the first things, which it expressly
and formally did, was to renew in life, art, and
politics, the same old paganism, upon the ruins of
which, so many centuries before, Christianity had
begun its upward and laborious ascent. Newly
fashioning then much of what was old, Christianity
had augmented all this with so much which was new,
that in a thousand years it had made a Renaissance
possible. And now the form of this Renaissance
threatened its own ascendancy in morals and in life.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the old spirit of conservatism in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
religion, and of preservation in the matter of morals,
maintained itself for a time, through those bodies of
religious men and clergymen, who had left the cloister
or the seminary, to take up their abode in the
secular seats of learning. It was this spirit which
originated the latest and best development of the
universities, that of the "college" system, established
in their midst. Salamanca had twenty colleges;
Louvain, forty; Paris, fifty. Still, in the final issue,
there was now scarcely any reserve force of cloistral
or episcopal learning behind the universities, and outside
of them. And the religious and the clergy
themselves, who at best were not a little out of their
element from the moment they migrated into the
secular environment, conformed insensibly to the conditions
in which they found themselves, and so far
ceased to be the power they had been.</p>

<p>Witness, in the time of Ignatius, the Paris University,
as described by contemporary records. "It was
fallen from its ancient splendor. The bonds of discipline
had been gradually relaxed; studies were abandoned;
and with masters, as with scholars, all love
of letters, and respect for the rule, had given place to
sombre passions, to political hate, to religious fanaticism
and dissolute <span class="locked">habits."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span></p>

<p>Here then we have two elements in the educational
condition of Europe, which explain the rise of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Jesuit system. One was the positive, concrete fact,
embodied in that great developed system of university
learning. The other was a negative element, the decline
therein of the essential moral life. These two
factors are not mere antecedents in the order of time,
as being only prior to the method of Loyola. One of
them, the university system, supplied the very material
out of which his method and matter were taken;
yes, and the men themselves, the Jesuits who applied
the principles of reform to education. The other factor,
which I have called negative, that decline of the
essential moral life, was the adequate occasion, which
prompted Ignatius to approach the question of education
at all. For we may say with confidence that, if
the universities of the sixteenth century were still
doing the work which originally they had been chartered
to do, the founder of the Society of Jesus would
not only have omitted to draw out his system as a
substitute for them, and as an improvement upon
them, but he would have done, what he always did
with anything good in existence; he would have used
what he found, and have turned his attention to other
things more urgent. He did use these university
centres for his own young men, until he had better
educational institutions, and a better method of his
own in progress.</p>

<p>Hence the educational problem, when it falls under
the notice of Ignatius, presents itself as the identical
one of old, that of moral regeneration. But it is a
different state of the same question. In circumstances
rendered acutely critical by the agitations of the epoch,
social, moral, and religious, it was a favorite contemplation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of his to look with compassion on men living
like the blind, dying, and sinking into eternal depths;
on men talking, blaspheming, reviling one another;
on their assaulting, wounding, slaying one another;
and all together going to eternal <span class="locked">perdition.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> It was
from this moral point of view that he descended into
the arena of education.</p>

<p>But before he can teach men, or mould teachers
of men, or even conceive the first idea of legislating
for the intellectual world, he must himself first learn.
There are two fundamental lessons which he does
learn, and they go to form him. One is that, among
all pursuits, the study of virtue is supreme; the other,
that, supreme as virtue is, yet, without secular learning,
the highest virtue goes unarmed, and at best is
profitable to oneself alone. He learns these two lessons,
not only in theory, but in practice. To accomplish
the purpose of the latter, he takes his seat upon
the scholars' bench, and begins to learn with little
children. Though he may not meet with brilliant
success in the art of learning, still in the art of understanding
what learning is, and in the lessons of experience,
he becomes a finished scholar. He remains
even then too much of a chevalier to give up a cherished
idea of his about a spiritual crusade in the East.
And it is only when thwarted in this project that,
like a true knight, he simply turns to another side of
the field. He stays in the West. He is still the
Captain of a Company. But he becomes also a legislator
among doctors; and, amid his other works, he
effects an educational reform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
In his whole campaign, we may discern two characteristics
in the spirit of his movements. One is that
of defence, the other that of advance. His method of
defence showed itself in the reassertion of old principles,
in the conservatism of morals,&mdash;a plan of campaign,
which determines the whole frame of mind,
and the social construction of the Company. It rests
on the principle of upholding what is, and not moving
the ancient landmarks. On the other hand, his advance
is towards the solution of the highest questions
which can interest mankind. These formed part of
the very object and direction of the Order's march.
And so it came to pass, that his Company drew to
itself that class of minds which are most powerfully
arrested by the prospect of solving such questions,
especially when times are agitated. His times were
agitated, if any ever were, more so than our own,
when the same questions still must dominate. His
were times of wars with Turks in the East, and with
Christians at home; of battles lost and won, with
their effects reaching into every household; of royal
and imperial administrations confused and overthrown;
of new opinions without number; of the
Church losing ground along the whole line of the
frontier, and withal new worlds looming over an horizon,
where from the beginning of time the unknown
had brooded in absolute darkness. At such a moment,
"Defence and Advance," or as the Papal authority
expressed it in the solemn instrument which chartered
his Institute, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Defensio ac propagatio fidei</i>, were stirring
watchwords to men of parts, who felt restive
under the inactivity and inefficiency of older methods,
on older lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
I will not pause to say, that the personal poverty
and exact obedience, required in the new service, presented
no obstacles to the minds and characters which
were otherwise attracted to his standard. The antecedents
of all antiquity seem to show that such conditions,
to such minds, are rather an inducement than a
check. And if one takes notice that to this was
added, in the Order of Jesus, an absolute equality,
whereby every formed member binds himself to accept
no dignity within or without, or, at least, to affect
no dignity at home or abroad, which will prejudice his
full franchise as a member, then, perhaps, the attractiveness
of such a life, the conservatism and intense
concentration of the Order, as well as the alacrity and
endurance manifested in the service, will not appear
inexplicable to the minds of this age, in which, under
a very different form, the same equality is called liberty,
is made to construct republics, to bring down
monarchies, and develop some of the most potent agencies
for unfolding the energies of men. Yet the liberty
of this latter equality reflects but faintly, and as
from a broken surface, the freedom of him, who having
liberated himself from the shackles of the world,
and from all solicitude as to his movements, office, and
place, finds in turn, as the German historian expresses
it, "his own personal development imposed upon
<span class="locked">him";<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> and, in the firm companionship of one aim,
formation, and life, enjoys the manifold support and
ready sympathy of individualities as developed as his
own.</p>

<p>I shall narrate, in the first part, the facts of Ignatius'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
career, so far as to indicate the stages of that
magisterial art, by which he himself was formed, and
which then he reformed in the Jesuit <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>.
In the second part, I shall sketch briefly the history
of the <i>Ratio</i> itself, and analyze the System as a theory
and practice of education.</p>

<span class="subhead">KNIGHT, PILGRIM, AND SCHOLAR.</span></h2>

<p>The story of the cavalier wounded on the ramparts
of Pampeluna has often been told. Loyola was not
at the moment governor of the city, nor in any responsible
charge. But official responsibility was not
necessary for him to see the path of duty and follow
it. As one bound to the service of his sovereign by
the title of honor and nobility, he retired to the
citadel, when the town surrendered; and then, when
the ramparts began to give way under the cannonading,
he stood in the breach. A ball shattering the
rock laid him low, maimed in both his limbs. At
once the defence collapsed. Cared for chivalrously
by those whose arms had struck him down in battle,
he was transported with every delicate attention to
his castle of Loyola. It was found that one of his
limbs had been ill set. He had it broken again, to be
set aright. Meanwhile, instinct with all the ambition
of a knight, belonging to a chivalrous nation in an
age of chivalry, he was not insensible to the charms
of society and affection. And, out of a sensitive care
for his personal appearance, he must needs have a
protruding bone, which still threatened to mar his
figure, sawed off while he looked on. In the loneliness
and tedium of a sick-room, he whiled away the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
hours by dreaming of his ambitions and his aspirations,
and he sought to feed them with suitable
nourishment. He wanted a romance to read. There
was none to be had. So, instead of the novel which
was not forthcoming, he took what they gave him,
the Life of Christ, and the Lives of some who had
served Christ faithfully. The soldier of the field
and of blood felt the objects of his ambition change;
he became a soldier of the spirit and eternal life.
And, after the experiences of his bed of pain, and the
protracted communings with another world, he arose
another man; he went forth a knight as ever, but not
on an expedition terminating as before. An evening
and night spent in the sanctuary of Montserrat, as
once before he had passed a vigil of arms, when
dubbed a chevalier by the King of Navarre; a morning
begun with the Holy Sacrifice attended and Holy
Communion received, opened to him a new era; and
he went forth, bound now by a new oath of fealty to
the service of the King of Heaven.</p>

<p>At the side of the altar in this sanctuary of Montserrat,
the Abbot of the monastery, eighty-one years
later, committed to a marble tablet the record of this
event, for the perpetual memory of the future:
"Blessed Ignatius of Loyola here, with many
prayers and tears, devoted himself to God and the
Virgin. Here, as with spiritual arms, he fortified
himself in sack-cloth, and spent the vigil of the
night. Hence he went forth to found the Society of
Jesus, in the year MDXXII."</p>

<p>He first looked about him to find a retreat, and
immerse himself in the contemplation of time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
eternity. It was a Saturday. John Sacrista Pascual
tells us that his mother, a devout lady of Manresa,
was in the church that morning; and, accompanied by
two young men and three women, she was at her
devotions in the chapel of the Apostles. A young
stranger came up and accosted them. His clothing
was of very common serge; for Ignatius had given
away his knightly robes to a poor man. The youth
looked like a pilgrim. He was not tall; he was fair
in complexion and ruddy in cheek. His bare head
was somewhat bald. Altogether he was of a fine and
grave presence, and most reserved in look. He
scarcely raised his eyes from the ground. Coming
up, he asked if there were a hospital anywhere
which might serve him for shelter. Regarding his
noble and fair features, the lady, as became a Christian
woman, offered her services; if he would follow
her company, she would provide for him, in the best
way possible. Courteously and thankfully he accepted
her offer, and followed the party as they left
the sanctuary. They proceeded slowly; for they
noticed that he was lame. However much they urged
him, they could not induce him to ride upon the ass.
Three leagues away from Montserrat, they arrived at
the little town of Manresa; and he took up his residence
in the common hospital for the poor and pilgrims.
Whatever alms or food was henceforth sent
him first went to others, whom, in these matters, up
to the end of his life, he always considered to be more
in need than himself.</p>

<p>He now entered on his probation of Christian virtue.
In the mind of the Catholic Church, the degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
of virtue which he practised is that accounted heroic.
As it is not for me to dwell on it here, I will pass it
over with one remark. That which is accounted
ordinary Christian virtue, resting as it does on faith
and hope, on principles not barely natural but supernatural,
is not very intelligible to the world at large.
Still less the heroic degree of the same. Both however
claim to be estimated by their own proper
motives and principles. When they enter into the
very subject, which the biographer means to treat, it
appertains to his art not to ignore the objective
motives and reasons of things, as they operated in his
subject. In the shortest monograph, like the present,
we cannot separate from the work, which he did, the
man who did it. And the man is made by his
motives. It were bad literary art to describe feats,
which are confessedly great, and not to find motives
which are proportionate.</p>

<p>Ignatius, after a year more or less spent at Manresa,
took his pilgrim's staff and journeyed on foot to Italy,
and thence to the Holy Land. It was in the spirit of
the old Crusaders, whose chivalry had a charm for
him up to the day many years later, when, with his
first associates of the Company, he endeavored once
more to cross over from Italy to Palestine. Had he
succeeded on this later occasion, he would most probably
never have known the others who attached themselves
to him; nor might history have busied itself
with him or with them.</p>

<p>At the date of his return from the Holy Land, we
find that he has advanced already to the second lesson
in the development of his future. It is, that mature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
in years as he is, and full of desires for doing good to
his neighbors, yet neither does mere piety place in his
hands the instruments for such work; nor, if study
alone can give the means of apostolic zeal, can he consider
himself exempt from the law, that he must labor
to acquire what are only the results of labor. He
was thirty-one years of age, when he betook himself,
after his night's vigil, to the cave of Manresa. He is
two years older now. So, at the age of thirty-three,
he sits down on the school-bench at Barcelona, and
begins his Latin declensions.</p>

<p>Begrudging his studies the time which they demand
exclusively, he mistakes the situation, and allows himself
the exercises of an apostolic life. At his age, even
supposing his earlier pursuits to have been more in
harmony with his present life of letters, he is not an
apt pupil. However, he labors conscientiously. After
two years spent at Grammar, he is judged by his
teacher, who takes a lenient view of the case, to be
competent for approaching his higher studies.</p>

<p>He himself was dubious. His friends recommended
him to ascend. He still hesitated. But, receiving
the same favorable opinion from a theologian whom
he consulted, Ignatius acquiesced, in accordance with
his unvarying rule, to follow competent direction.
How unfortunate this step was for the happy progress
of his studies, but how advantageous for his experience
as a future legislator, I shall proceed to show.</p>

<p>Leaving Barcelona for Alcalà, he meant to enjoy
the best advantages which a great university could
afford. He lived on alms as ever; and others lived
on the alms which he received. It was the year 1626.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
He entered upon the study of Logic, using the Summa
of Di Soto; also the Physics of Aristotle; and he
pursued besides the Master of Sentences.</p>

<p>He had stayed only a year and a half in this rich
variety of pursuits, scholastic as well as apostolic,
when the novelties apparent in his manner of life
ended by making him a suspected character to the
ecclesiastical authorities. To a few, among the population
of the city, his fruitful zeal made him distinctly
odious. The result was a juridical process
against him, which issued in a complimentary verdict,
the Vicar of the diocese pronouncing him and
his companions quite blameless. But restrictions
were imposed regarding his future ministrations,
since Ignatius was not yet in holy orders. During a
term of four years he was not to preach. After that
time, his progress in studies would enable him to
honor that important ministry, without giving offence.
This was a deathblow to the aspirations of the student.
He made up his mind to go elsewhere, to the
famous university of Salamanca; and he turned his
back on Alcalà.</p>

<p>The time was soon to come for a pleasant revenge;
and apparently he knew of it long before it came.
Just six years after the foundation of his Order, when
he sent Francis Villanova to open a house at Alcalà,
not only did he find men of the university embracing
his Institute, but, two years after that, the whilom persecuted
pilgrim received, in a single twelvemonth,
thirty-four Doctors into the Society, all from that one
seat of learning. The mere passing by of Francis
Borgia, Duke of Gandia, who had become an humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
follower of Ignatius, made the choicest spirits flock to
his standard; and, all over Spain, colleges sprang up as
if from the soil.</p>

<p>In Salamanca, where likewise he and his were to
figure in the future, the personal history of Ignatius
is briefly told. In ten or twelve days after his arrival,
he was thrown into chains. He spent twenty-two
days in prison. When released, with the same
commendation for himself and his doctrine as he had
received at Alcalà, but with a similar restriction on
his action, he thought it was not worth his while to
repeat the same experiences at the same cost. So, in
spite of all the eloquence of dissuasion brought to
bear on him by friends, he took a new departure,
which seemed plausible to him, and therefore feasible.
He would try his fortunes in another land, and continue
his studies in the greatest philosophical and
theological centre of the world, the University of
Paris.</p>

<p>To any one who judged of things by an ordinary
standard, the project was not feasible. War was
raging between Spain and France; the roads were
infested with hostile soldiery; many murders and
robberies, committed on the persons of travellers,
were recently reported. But these and other considerations
of the kind had no weight with Loyola, to
stay him in a course once deliberately adopted. Accepting
some alms from friends at Barcelona, to
obtain on the way the necessaries of life, he accomplished
on foot the whole journey from Barcelona to
the French capital; where he arrived at the beginning
of February, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1528.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
He has now had experience of prisons and chains,
on the charge of teaching error, or of being a dangerous
enthusiast. One of the calmest and coolest
of men, who never acted, but he first calculated, and
who never allowed himself to approach a conclusion,
without first freeing himself from all bias and impulse,
he had suffered repeated arrest for setting people
beside themselves, for moving them to give up all
they had in behalf of piety, or charity, and inducing
them to go and live on alms themselves; nay, perhaps
throw in their lives, talents and acquirements,
to serve others gratis. The founder of the Jesuits,
himself the first of an Order which has the reputation
of being the staunchest upholder, as well of authority
in every rank of society, as of the truths taught by
the Catholic Church, was put in chains, or arraigned
by the ecclesiastical authorities almost wherever he
appeared, though always acquitted as blameless.</p>

<p>In a letter written at a subsequent period of his
life to King John III of Portugal, Ignatius sums up
his experiences, as including two imprisonments, at
Alcalà and Salamanca; three judicial investigations,
at Alcalà, Salamanca, and Paris; later on, another
process at Paris; then one at Venice; finally another
at Rome;&mdash;eight investigations about this one man
in Spain, France, and <span class="locked">Italy.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> Wherever he came, in
after life, it passed as a proverb among the Fathers,
that his appearance was the sure harbinger of a storm,
soon to break out against them somewhere, in the
social or religious world. He braved all this fury in
his own manner, weighing as deliberately every word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
he spoke, and measuring every step he took, as when
he had stood in the breach of the ramparts at Pampeluna.
But his personal experience made him commit
to the sacred keeping of the "Spiritual Exercises"
an important principle of liberal and humane prudence.
It is couched in the first words of his little
book, to guide teacher and learner alike. He <span class="locked">says:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"In the first place, it is to be supposed that every
pious Christian man should be more ready to interpret
any obscure proposition of another in a good
rather than a bad sense. If, however, he cannot
defend the proposition in any way, let him inquire of
the speaker himself; and, if then the speaker is found
to be mistaken in sentiment or understanding, let
him correct the same kindly. If this is not enough,
let him employ all available means to render him
sound in principle and secure from error."</p>

<p>How far the personal experiences of its founder
attached by a law of heritage to his Order, I can
hardly undertake to describe. But, just for the sake
of completing the family picture, I will mention the
heads of a doleful list, which an historian of the Society
catalogues. He enumerates, as objects of attack
and misrepresentation, the founder himself, the name
of the Society of Jesus, the dress, rules, manners,
books, doctrine, schools, sermons; the poverty, obedience,
gratuitous service of the Jesuits; that they
affected a kind of literary empire, under the spur of
an intolerable ambition; that they were lightly tinctured,
and had just sipped of many things, of which
they had nothing solid to offer; yes, that they wanted
to have it believed there was no sanctuary of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Muses, no shrine of sacred or human wisdom in existence,
outside of their own colleges; that, from these
offices of theirs, all arts and sciences came forth, done
up in the best style. "In fine, whatever they do or
don't do, granted that there are many false charges
which their enemies concoct against them,&mdash;things
too extreme to be believed,&mdash;granted that they are
acquitted of many vices laid to their account, never
certainly will they escape the suspicion, at least,
which these charges <span class="locked">excite."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> We believe it. There
is a good homely English proverb which expresses
the very same idea&mdash;about the happy adhesiveness
of a clayey compound when cleverly thrown.</p>

<p>This retrospect of history was taken, exactly one
hundred years after the foundation of the Order.
The story had begun some thirteen years before it
was founded. When Ignatius became a responsible
leader with associates, he had recourse more than once
to the process of justice, to clear his reputation in full
form. But, beyond the cases which rendered such
defence prudent and necessary, his practical policy
was expressed in a practical maxim, which after him
his successor, James Laynez, had often in his mouth:
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Deus faxit ne unquam male loquantur et vera dicant!</i>
"God grant they never talk ill of me and be saying
the truth!" Indeed, as there is no use in trying
to change men, for they will never be born anew,
Ignatius looked rather in another direction for the
solution of difficulties; expecting that troubles, which
defied other treatment, might still not survive their
authors. Speaking of a powerful adversary, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
raising a great storm at Toledo and Alcalà, and whom
it took the royal council and then a brief from the
Pope to quell, Ignatius said of him to Ribadeneira:
"He is old, the Society is young; naturally the
Society will live longer than he will." The same dignitary,
suppressed though he was, rose again in violent
opposition. Whereupon Jouvancy makes the
apt remark: "So difficult is it for even the most eminent
men, and so rare a thing, when once they have
conceived a notion, to get it out of their heads again!"<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>
No, men are not born anew.</p>

<p>It is time now to contemplate Ignatius of Loyola
at Paris, where some of the most precious elements
in his educational experience are to be acquired.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS. ROME.</span></h2>

<p>Voluntary poverty, the austerest manner of life,
the ungrateful labor of studies, and the perpetual self-discipline
of a mind like his, ever bent on lofty
thoughts and endeavoring to dominate the very first
movements of his soul, all these conditions, added to
the climate and the nature of the situation in which
Ignatius found himself at Paris, brought such a strain
to bear on his broken-down constitution, that, to keep
up his course at all, he had to interrupt it awhile, and
give some relief to his overtaxed body, or, as he held
it to be, his "beast of burden."</p>

<p>And what about the studies themselves? If they
had been a brilliant success thus far, they could
scarcely have outlived such conditions of existence.
As it was, they were as good as if they had never
begun; or somewhat worse. He had gone about
them the wrong way. Whatever solidity of learning
he had kept objectively in view, something else,
equally important with solidity, had been unwittingly
omitted. That was a good method. Logic, Philosophy,
and Theology, all taken up together, and with
such compendious haste, now went together in his
mind like a machine out of joint; and his speed was
<i>nil</i>! The Latin language itself, the indispensable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
vehicle of all learning, was just so far possessed by
him as to show him that, to be of any real use, it had
better be commenced all over again.</p>

<p>Here his character asserted itself. And in no particular
of his life is he more like himself, more
thorough, more of a brave cavalier, "governing himself,
in great things and small, by reasons most high,"
than when, having little facility for such pursuits,
and less inclination, he makes up his mind, after a short
breathing spell, to sit down again at the age of thirty-seven
years, and resume his Latin declensions! In
the college of Montague, he spends about two years
acquiring this tongue. Meanwhile, he tries various
plans to find wherewithal to live.</p>

<p>I need not dwell on the nature of this great centre
into which Ignatius had penetrated, an unknown
stranger, just one of its tens of thousands of scholars.
It had more than two scores of colleges. To this,
the queen of universities, though she was going to be
no kind alma mater to him and his Order, still the
recollections of Loyola in his future legislation would
always turn back with reverence. His first Professors
for the Roman College, the typical institution
of the Society, would be taken from those of his
men who were Doctors of this university. And,
whatever might be the moral condition and the religious
lassitude of the university men, as compared
with this penniless stranger, in 1529, occasions were
to come in after times, when they showed themselves
not unworthy of the enemy whom they fought to the
death. When the plague of 1580 made a desert about
them, the university men and the Jesuits, otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
never seen together, save in the lists and face to face,
now were everywhere, and fell fast, side by side on
the field of Christian charity.</p>

<p>For the understanding of the Jesuit system, in its
origin and its form, attention must always be paid,
in the first place, to the kinship subsisting between
it and the Paris University. There are, besides, many
other degrees of relationship, which do not go unacknowledged,
in the formation of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>.
The system of the English universities may be
recognized in the line of ancestry. Whatever was
best anywhere enters the pedigree; as Lord Bacon
takes note, when delivering himself like a good philosopher,
but also like a good Protestant, he eulogizes
and stigmatizes in the same breath: "The ancient
wisdom of the best times," he says, "did always make
a just complaint, that states were too busy with their
laws, and too negligent in point of education; which
excellent part of the ancient discipline hath been in
some sort revived, of late times, by the colleges of the
Jesuits; of whom, although in regard of their superstition
I may say, '<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quo meliores, eo deteriores</i>'; yet in
regard of this, and some other points concerning
human learning and moral matters, I may say, as
Agesilaus said to his enemy Pharnabaus, '<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Talis quum
sis, utinam noster esses</i>.'"<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>In the University of Paris, then, as his real alma
mater, Ignatius commenced his course of Philosophy
in the year 1529. He finished it by standing successfully
the severe examination, called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">examen lapideum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
"the rocky test," considered the most searching of all
in the Paris Academy. He thus became a Master of
Arts, after Easter, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1534; having become Licentiate
in the previous year. Particulars about his four
examiners in the "rocky test," his graduation, the degrees
of his companions, with the dates, as found in
the Paris records, are given by the <span class="locked">Bollandists.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span></p>

<p>He now entered on his theological studies. It was
evident that the obstructions, which had thwarted so
many of his efforts heretofore, were disappearing one
by one. And more than that; the means were being
placed in his hands for the great work before him.
These means were a company of men. He was in the
midst of a devoted little band, each one of whom he
had won individually. They were Peter Lefèvre and
Francis Xavier; James Lainez and Alphonsus Salmeron,
both of them mere youths; there were Claude
Le Jay, John Coduri, Nicholas Bobadilla, Simon Rodriguez;
and lastly, the only one who at this time
was a Priest among their number, Pasquier Brouet.
Among these, never at their head though considered a
father by all, never leading the way, though on that
account showing himself the more effectively a leader,
Ignatius was all in all to each one of them. He
had previously acquired some valuable experience in
selecting and forming companions. But such as had
gathered round him in Spain were no longer with him.
Each one of his present party was a picked man.</p>

<p>When six of them were sufficiently advanced, he
and they held a solemnity, which was the real birthday
of the Society of Jesus. On the fifteenth day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
August, 1534, they took a vow, in the church of the
Blessed Virgin, at Montmartre in Paris. They bound
themselves to renounce all their goods by a given date,
and betake themselves to the Holy Land; failing in
that, they would throw themselves at the feet of the
Sovereign Pontiff, and offer him their absolute service.
Meanwhile they pursued their studies; and, as each
of the two following years brought round the fifteenth
day of August, it found them in the same place, and
with the same solemnity, and with an enlarged number,
renewing this vow. The legal birthday of the
Order came only with the Papal charter on September
27, 1540.</p>

<p>I shall pass over the movements of Loyola, when
bidden to go and recuperate in his native climate. He
returned to Spain, in 1535, leaving his companions
to study till 1537; and he settled the affairs of his
young Spanish associates at their homes. All, when
the time came, disposed of their goods in a summary
way. They gave to the poor, reserving nothing,
except what would pay their way to Venice, and
thence to the East. Their principle was, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dispersit,
dedit pauperibus</i>, "He hath distributed, he hath given
to the poor." Besides this, Xavier, at the date appointed,
gave up the last stage of his theological
studies, and resigned the glory of receiving the Doctor's
cap in Paris; the brilliant young Professor sacrificed
the one thing which had appealed most powerfully
to his ambition and imagination. Laynez was
recuperating from a severe illness, and could do
scarcely more than move. Nevertheless they are
all in Venice, when the early spring of 1537 arrives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Ignatius himself, meeting them there, has accomplished
the work which faced him thirteen years
before, and which he had taken in hand with his
Latin grammar. He is now forty-six years of age.</p>

<p>There are three lines of activity, in which the ability
and energy of Ignatius Loyola stand out before the
world. One is the capacity he showed as a governor
or leader of men; another is a similar competency to
direct souls in the spiritual life; the third is that,
which we are considering at present, his legislative
genius in the intellectual order. Admitting the
innate talent which must have been the basis and
foundation of his gift for governing, we may affirm
of all the rest, that the best part of his sagacity
and tact had been acquired by personal experience.
He learnt how to act by suffering. He perfected
his natural gift of guiding and commanding by
first submitting to all the contingencies of human
life.</p>

<p>We may develop the meaning of this in the present
matter, pedagogy; and the meaning of it will help to
unfold the subject. In quest of the necessaries of
life, he spent intervals of his studious career in travelling
from Paris to a great distance. He found himself
returning each year to Belgium, always on foot:
he visited Rouen, and even reached London, to address
the Spanish merchants there. It does not seem to
have been parsimony on their side that kept him in
such straitened circumstances. It was his principles
which were not all in keeping with his conditions
of life. He was endeavoring to combine the life of a
student with absolute poverty; and he aggravated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
inconveniences of such a state of dependence by placing
no limits to the exercise of his charity. It was
his deliberate choice; for he fed his mind continuously
upon the life and example of the King, to whom he
had sworn his service, Christ poor and in labor from
his youth. He spoke afterwards from the wisdom of
experience, when he said, that in absolute penury the
pursuit of science cannot easily subsist, and the culture
of the mind is impeded by the duties of providing
for the body. Hence he legislated that, though
poverty was to be the basis of his Institute, still the
members, as long as they were engaged in studies,
should be set free from all care of seeking the means
of subsistence.</p>

<p>He had endeavored to combine a life of apostolic
ministrations, though not yet a Priest, with that
requisite absorption of mind, which alone can warrant
scholastic success. And he saw what it had come to.
The very esteem and love, which he entertained for
the exercises of the higher spiritual life, interrupted
with intrusive thoughts that application to study,
which was the duty in hand. In order that no such
intrusion of even the most sacred pursuits should
obstruct the onward progress of the members in learning,
he defined by rule the measure of such occupations,
as long as study was the main duty.</p>

<p>Diseases weakened him. Therefore he took the
greatest pains to protect the health of the members.
While he lived, he did this with a personal and paternal
solicitude. In his Institute, he provided the same
for the future.</p>

<p>On commencing his studies, he embraced many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
branches at the same time; and he had suffered all
the consequences of disorder. Grasping at too many
things, he lost all; and he had then to retrieve all
with loss of time. To obviate any recurrence of such
costly experiences, he provided that the courses followed
in the Society should have nothing disordered
in them, nothing mutilated or curtailed; everything
was to be in method and system; until, system and
method having been carried out in every line, and the
special good of each department having been secured
sufficiently for the general plan, specialized perfection
should be consulted, after all that; and this was to be
the appointed life of individuals, while a rounded and
complete education remained the culture of all.</p>

<p>Once in later years he let fall these words, relative
to his early experience: "He would very much question
whether another but himself, having to struggle
with so many difficulties and obstacles in the course
of his studies, would have given so long a time to the
acquisition of the <span class="locked">sciences."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> Thus then was he oppressed
with poverty, without the satisfaction of acting
under orders; suffering so many diseases, and yet looking
neither to honor, dignity, nor other human reward,
such as is wont to draw men on, and animate them
under fatigue; finding no pleasure nor satisfaction in
the life of studies, an inducement which is so great
an alleviation to mortals in the work before them.
And, in all these respects, he was quite unlike the
very men whom he singled out, and enlisted in the
new service of devotion; unlike Francis Xavier, who
had seen with perfect indifference all his brothers take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
to their ancestral profession of arms, or to a courtier's
life, while he himself, with the whole force of an
ambitious soul, ran on successfully and brilliantly in
his chosen career, as a Professor; unlike Laynez and
Salmeron, whose extraordinary gifts had made them
Doctors of Philosophy and Divinity, while still, in
age, little more than mere youths; very unlike by
nature to the gentle make of Lefèvre, who began life
as a shepherd boy, and ever retained a pastoral sweetness
of character. Unlike all of them, Loyola, a
soldier born and bred, and still true to his profession,
discarded every consideration of taste, comfort, and
convenience, in view of one objective point to be
reached: through thirteen years he struggled towards
it; and, when that time of probation was over, he was
a marked man. According to the law, that like
attracts like, and like begets like, he was surrounded
by a company of marked men, few if you count their
number, many if you consider the type. His name
was widely known, and favorably so. When he had
been paying five times over the price of his daily
bread, by travelling to Belgium, to Rouen, and London,
and collecting there some Spanish florins, the
event seemed to show that he had been but opening
the door, here and there and everywhere, for his colleges
and universities in the future; albeit, if they
came, adversaries came too, in proportion. But
clouds and storms purify the air. When they come
again, they will still leave the air the clearer for their
coming. If the laws of human conduct are consistent
in one way, they are consistent in another. The disturbance
comes, but it does its work and goes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
M. Cretineau-Joly, the popular French historian in
our own times, speaking of events at a later juncture
in the life of Loyola, makes the following observation:
"Loyola," he says, "could apply to himself
admirably well that proverb which says, 'When a
Spaniard is driving a nail into the wall, and his hammer
breaks, the Spaniard will drive the nail in with
his head!'" Loyola would have his idea go through
at any cost.</p>

<p>We shall now follow him to Italy and Rome.</p>

<p>In the year 1537, Rome was not quite the luxurious
capital which had fallen under the sword of the Constable
of Bourbon. The eternal city, whose Papal
Sovereigns have left it on record from time immemorial,
that in no part of the world were they less
recognized as lords than in their own city, had undergone
a purification, which differed, not substantially,
but only in its consequences, from what was called
for, over half the countries of Europe. The riches,
the luxury, the idleness, which elsewhere resulted in
a complete change of religious history for many of
the northern nations, had here brought about a catastrophe
which sobered minds. And no longer an
exclusive absorption in elaborate sloth prevented a
large portion of the influential element here from
doing honor to the Queen of European civilization, by
doing good to the world.</p>

<p>All roads still led to Rome. Thence too all roads
diverged. It was still true, that whatever commanded
this centre could reach out, if only by the force of
prestige, to the uttermost limits of the civilized
domain. Whatever this venerable source of authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
chartered to go on its way, in strength and benediction,
had reason to behold, in the privilege so
bestowed, the auspicious opening of a useful career,
intellectual or moral. It is so to-day, though not in
a temporal sense. The charter, or confirmation, or
bull, which conveys the recognition of the Church's
Head to a project, a cause, or an institute, bestows
thereupon a moral power which naturally transcends
every franchise in the gift of the most powerful governments.
Compared with it, they are local. And,
standing no comparison with it, under a moral aspect,
they do not pretend to such a power as touches the
inner conscience of nations.</p>

<p>When therefore Ignatius turned to the great
Rome, he was like the skilful commander whom he
describes in a certain place; he was possessing himself
of the vantage-ground, taking the citadel. It
would be more correct to say, as all history avers,
that he meant to defend that citadel, the See of Rome.
He had waited nearly a year at Venice, to carry out
his project of voyaging to Jerusalem. War made that
impossible. Now, in accordance with the express proviso
in their vow, he and his companions repaired to
Rome, and offered their services to the spiritual head
of Christendom.</p>

<p>To win approbation for a new religious institute was
no easy matter; then less than ever. The recent
occurrences in the North had been due to this, among
other moral causes, that the later history of certain
religious orders, which centuries before had begun one
way, latterly had taken a novel and fatal turn. Still,
in spite of criticism and hostility, chiefly in the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
places, Ignatius received at length the approving word
of the Pope; and his Institute was chartered with a
bull of confirmation. Henceforth, the evolution of
events belongs to general history. What concerns us,
in this chartering of the plan and Institute of Ignatius
Loyola, is the new character it gave to education,
and the epoch it made in the intellectual history
of the world. To explain this matter, we may follow
briefly the deliberations which the Fathers held, and
in the course of which, among other conclusions, they
came to decide upon reëstablishing education.</p>

<p>It was the fourth of May, 1539, a year and a half
before their services were finally accepted by the
Pope. Such of the ten members as were then in
Rome occupied themselves, after the labors of the
day, in nightly deliberations, which were protracted
during three months. They decreed, among other
things, that they should teach boys and uncultured
persons the necessary points of Christian doctrine, at
least once a year, and for a definite time. This decree
obviously is not about that secondary and superior
education of youth, which is our subject; neither does
it concern primary education, of which there is nowhere
question in the Institute of the Jesuits. But,
as the Constitution subsequently drawn up says,
"this work of charity, in the Divine service, is more
likely to be consigned to oblivion, and to pass into
disuse, than other duties more specious in their character,
as preaching," <span class="locked">etc.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span></p>

<p>Teaching Christian doctrine pertains to the duty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
those who have the ordinary care of souls. No
duty of this kind, as belonging to the ordinary sphere
of the Church's clergy, would Ignatius assume as
characteristic of his own Institute, except this one.
He was, indeed, more than ready to throw in his contribution
of personal zeal and charity, for the furtherance
of all kinds of benevolence and beneficence.
Personally, at the cost of untiring activity, he sowed,
as Genelli well observes, the first seeds of those ameliorations
in social life, and of those humane institutions,
which are so marked a feature of later <span class="locked">ages.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span>
He was an original benefactor of humanity at the
turning-point of modern history, which has since
become an era of social organized beneficence. Urban
VIII solemnly testifies, that Ignatius organized homes
for orphans, for catechumens, for unprovided women;
that the poor and the sick, that children and the ignorant
and prisoners, were all objects of his personal <span class="locked">solicitude.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span>
These works of zeal and charity became, in
subsequent years, the specific reasons of existence for
various other communities, which rose in order and in
number. But he did not adopt them as specific in his
Institute; nor did he assume as characteristic anything
within the province of the ordinary parochial clergy,
except the teaching of Christian doctrine to boys and
uncultured persons. The rest he attended to, while
not provided for; ready to drop them, when provision
should be made for them.</p>

<p>But he did assume five works, which were outside
of the ordinary lines; and, among them, is the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
of our study, the Education of <span class="locked">Youth.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> As the selection
of all these specialties for his Institute reveal
the commander's eye resting on a field, where many
issues were being fought out, so, in particular, his
selection of education as a specialty betrayed the
same masterly thought, in the institutions he projected,
in the scope he proposed, and, above all, in the
formation of his teachers.</p>

<p>There had been, among the Fathers deliberating, a
difference of opinion, with respect to Christian doctrine.
Bobadilla had dissented from making that
work the subject of a special vow; and the others
deferred to him. But there was unanimity with
regard to every other topic of deliberation, including
this one, "the education of youth, having colleges in
<span class="locked">universities."<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span></p>

<p>As defined by Jesuit authors, the education of youth
means the gratuitous teaching of Letters and Science,
from almost the first beginnings of Grammar up to
the culminating science of Sacred Theology, and that
for boys and students of every kind, in schools open
to <span class="locked">all.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> Evidently these university men, who were
engaged in drawing up the Institute, considered that,
if the greatest Professor's talents are well spent in
the exposition of the gravest doctrines in Theology,
Philosophy, and Science, neither he, nor any one else,
is too great to be a schoolmaster, a tutor, and a father,
to the boy passing from childhood on to the state of
manhood,&mdash;that boyhood which, as Clement of Alexandria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
says, furnishes the very milk of age, and from
which the constitution of the man receives its temper
and complexion.</p>

<p>It is requisite here to observe, that there was no
such thing in existence, as State Education. Two reasons
may briefly be mentioned for this, one of them
intrinsic to the question, the other an historical fact.
The intrinsic and essential reason was the sacred character
of education, as being an original function, belonging
to the primary relations of parents and child.
States, or organized commonwealths, come only in the
third or fourth degree of human society. It was
much later, in that short interval between the extinction
of the Society of Jesus and the outburst of the
French Revolution, that new theories came to be proclaimed,
as La Chalotais did openly proclaim them,
of a bald and blank deism in social life, and therefore
of secularizing education. Between deism and secularization
the connection was reasonable. For, if the
rights of God went by the board, there was no reason
why the rights of parents and children should
remain. All alike, the persons and "souls of <span class="locked">men,"<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span>
fell back into the condition in which Christianity had
found them; they became chattels of the state, mannikins
of a bureau in peace, "food for powder" in war.</p>

<p>The other reason was an historical fact. For all the
purposes of charity, mercy, and philanthropy, there
were powers in existence, as part of the normal religious
life of general Christian society. They were the
same powers that had made Christendom, and had
carried it on so far as the Christian world, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
to which we owe the civilization of to-day. More
than that. As there is not a single work of charity
or mercy, say St. Thomas Aquinas, which may not be
made the object of an institution, religious men or
women devoting their lives as a service to God, in a
special service towards their neighbors; so, in point
of fact, there were very few such objects which had
not originated some service of religious self-consecration
in their behalf.</p>

<p>Now, as operating on education in particular, the
powers in the world were, as they had been, almost
entirely clerical or religious. In the universities,
there were clergymen and Religious. All the great
institutions had the religious cast about them. The
old ones have it still. Traces of it hang about Oxford
and Cambridge. The Church founded them and supervised
them. Kings protected them. And the highest
outcome of their schools was Divinity in its widest
sense; that is to say, the triple knowledge of God, and
of man as signed with the light of God's countenance,
and of nature as bearing the impress of God's footstep.
As it was in the universities, so, outside too,
all pedagogic influence had rested with religious men.</p>

<p>But no one of all these religious powers was bound
by its constitution to this labor of education, which
Loyola now, formally and expressly, assumed as part
of his work. It is at this stage of history, that education
enters into the fundamental plan of a Religious
Order. This is a fact, and an epoch, of prime importance
in Pedagogics.</p>

<p>For, inasmuch as education entered thus into the
plan of a Religious Order, it became the vocation of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
moral body, which, while incorporated like other bodies,
did not confine itself, like single universities, to
limited circumstances of place; it was a body diffusive.
And so with regard to conditions of time;
though all corporations give an assurance of perpetuity,
a diffusive body like this does more; it multiplies
the assurance, in proportion to its own diffusiveness.</p>

<p>And again, inasmuch as the body which undertook
the work of education was a religious one, bound to
poverty, it guaranteed that the members would endow
the work, at their own cost, with that which is the
first, the essential, and most expensive endowment,
among all others,&mdash;the labors, the attainments, and
the lives of competent men, all gratuitously given.
This endowment, which is so substantial, is besides
so far-reaching, that no other temporal foundation
would be needed, were it not that the necessaries of
life, and the apparatus for their work, are still necessary
to living men, even though they live in personal
poverty.</p>

<p>Thus then it was that Ignatius took in charge the
secondary and superior education of the Christian
world, as far as his services should be called for:
he threw into the work the endowment of a Religious
Order. This, as the sequel proved, meant the whole
revival of learning. Lord Bacon bears witness to it
in a few words, when he says, that the Jesuits "partly
in themselves, and partly by the emulation and provocation
of their example, have much quickened and
strengthened the state of <span class="locked">learning."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> Father Daniel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
gives some of the details in a summary way. He
says: "The exclusively University régime of the late
centuries replaced, for a notable portion of students,
by a scholastic discipline much more complete; Scholastic
Philosophy and Theology renovated, through the
care applied to prevent young men from throwing
themselves too early into the disputes of the schools;
in fine, Literature and Grammar resuming the place
they had lost in the twelfth century, and, over and
above that, enjoying the new resources created for
their use by the Renaissance; all this I call a capital
fact in the history of the human mind, and even in
the history of the <span class="locked">Church."<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span></p>

<p>After the time of Ignatius, other religious congregations,
fortified with their own special means for
respective departments of activity, entered upon the
same general field of work. They were the Oratorians,
the Barnabites, the Fathers of the Pious Schools,
the Brothers of the Christian Schools, and others
whose names may occur in the course of this essay.
And, for the education of women, inferior and superior
alike, congregations of devoted religious women came
into being, and opened their convents to supply the
best and highest culture.</p>

<p>For fear that, in the execution of this plan, and in
their other enterprises of devotion and zeal, any
secondary intentions or results, with regard to power
and office, might mar the purity of the work and
defeat the main object, the same men, whose future
under the generalship of such a leader was about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
open as one of transcendent influence in the civilized
world, bound themselves by vow never to accept
any dignity or office in the Church. Naturally they
should keep aloof from affairs of state. In fact, it
would be incompatible with their own purposes of
literary and scientific competence, to leave themselves
at the mercy of other men's views, and be drafted
into posts outside of the Institute, and be placed in
an impossible situation for working out the specific
end intended. It would be suicidal too. Just when
a man was capable of continuing his kind, he would
be lost to the body, and be rendered incapable thereby
of propagating his own type of eminence. Besides,
without touching upon the inner reasons of the spiritual
life, which made this resignation of all honors
desirable, it is a fact standing out in clear relief,
as history sketches the marvellous fecundity of an
Order requiring such a high level of attainments,
that many of the choicest souls have felt specially
attracted to a kind of life, which at one and the
same time satisfied their ideas of Christian perfection,
and cut them off from all the paths of worldly
glory.</p>

<p>And now, to mention in the last place another
point, which is equally important for understanding
the educational history of the Order, and to the general
mind is equally obscure with some of those mentioned
already, there was introduced the principle of
religious obedience. It was sanctioned by a unanimous
<span class="locked">vote.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> The Fathers had concluded the first
deliberation, whether they should form a society at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
all; and they had decided in the affirmative <span class="locked">sense.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span>
Then the question took this phase. If they were to
found a closely-knitted society, they could do so only
by assuming a strict bond. That was none other
than a strict obedience.</p>

<p>On this head, as on all others that came in order,
they began the deliberation by reasoning, one day,
in an adverse sense, all having prepared their minds
to emphasize every objection which they could find
against it. The day following, they argued in a positive
sense. The motives in favor of strict obedience
won their unanimous assent. They were such as
<span class="locked">these:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If this congregation undertook the charge of affairs,
and the members were not under orders, no one could
be held responsible for an exact administration of the
charge. If the body were not bound together by
obedience, it could not long persevere; yet this was
their first intention, to remain associated in a permanent
body. Whence they concluded that scattered
as they would be, and already had been, in assiduous
and diverse labors, they must be united by a strict
principle of subordination, if they were to remain
such a body. Another argued thus: Obedience begets
heroism of virtue; since the truly obedient man is
most prompt to execute whatever duty is assigned
him by one, whom, as by a religious act, he regards
as being in the place of God, and signifying to him
God's will: wherefore obedience and heroism go together.</p>

<p>This reasoning seems to be enforced by the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
of all great nations, in the crises of their military and
other public affairs. But, as is clear, the principles
of religious obedience are of a different order; they
are on a higher plane; and they reach much farther in
time and eternity, than those of obedience elsewhere.</p>

<p>Here then we discern, sufficiently for present purposes,
the meaning and historical location of this
Institute. The members have cut themselves off
from the possession of all private property, by the
voluntary engagement to poverty, and thereby they
have prepared the endowment, on which education
will chiefly rest,&mdash;that is to say, the endowment consisting
of the men to teach, and their services tendered
gratis. Position and dignity are alike rendered inaccessible
by an express vow of the members professed.
Obedience keeps the organization mobile as a company
of trained soldiers. And, if any observant mind, well
acquainted with the course of human affairs, detects
in these principles some reasons for success, normal,
habitual, and regular, in the face of unnumbered obstacles,
and of unremitting hostility, his view will be singularly
corroborated when he rises to a plane higher,
and regards the same principles as "religious," carrying
with them the sanction of divine worship; which
I should be loath to call "enthusiasm," much less
"fanaticism." These sentiments are never very prudent,
nor enlightened, nor cool; they are either very
natural or are short-lived. A mild fever of fanaticism
can scarcely produce high results; and a high fever
of the same can scarcely last three hundred and
fifty years, with perpetuity still threatening. But I
would call this phenomenon, in its origin, religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
devotion; in its consequences, a supernatural efficiency;
and, taking it all in all, that which is called
a grace of vocation.</p>

<p>On the 27th day of September, 1540, the Society of
Jesus received from the See of Rome its bull of confirmation,
by which it became a chartered body of the
Church. While these pages were being penned, the
27th day of September came by, 1890. It was the anniversary
of that foundation, three hundred and fifty
years ago.</p>

<span class="subhead">COLLEGES AS PROPOSED IN THE JESUIT CONSTITUTION.</span></h2>

<p>The written rule about the system of education is
found in a double stage of development. The first is
that in which Loyola left it: it gives us the outline.
The second is that in which Aquaviva completed it:
this presents us with the finished picture. Likewise
in the historical course of administration out in the
world, the development is twofold. It runs its first
course from Loyola to Aquaviva, while experience
was still tentative. Its second course was subsequent
to Aquaviva, when experience, having gathered in its
results, had only to apply the approved form. This
was subject thenceforth to none but incidental
changes, as times and places change. And, for these
contingencies, the application remained expressly and
always pliable.</p>

<p>Hence, whatever was embodied in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>,
as completed, had been the result of the most
varied experience before legislating, an experience
in the life of the Order extending over fifty-nine
years. Whatever this universal experience had not
yielded as a positive result, or as applicable to all
places, was not embodied. Teachers are different;
national customs vary; vernacular tongues are not
the same. With regard to these mutable elements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the maxim of the Order in studies, in teaching, in
conducting colleges, was the same as that which it
proposed to itself in the various other functions of
practical life. An exponent of the Institute states
the maxim thus: "One should have a most exact
knowledge of the country, nation, city, manner of
government, manners of the people, states of life,
inclinations, etc.; and this from histories, from intercourse,
<span class="locked">etc."<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> General indications alone are given
with regard to these variable factors. The same is
done with respect to new sciences, which from the
time of the Renaissance were felt to be approaching
and developing. Subsequent legislation arises to
meet them as they come.</p>

<p>While the Fathers were carrying on the same deliberations
to which I referred in the preceding chapter,
a resolution was taken to leave the drafting of a Constitution
in the hands of those who should remain in
Italy. Circumscribing the task still more, they decided
to appoint a committee of two, who should
address themselves to this work, and report to the
rest. The general assembly when convened would
issue the final decree. Whatever that should be, such
of those present as might then be absent hereby
endorsed it beforehand.</p>

<p>Their small number of ten was already reduced to
six members present, the other four being scattered in
divers countries. They designated as a commission
Fathers Ignatius and John Coduri. Soon afterwards
Coduri died, and the rest were distributed through
the countries of Europe, Africa, and the far East.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
During the following years, Laynez, who was for
some time Provincial of Italy, remained more regularly
than the rest within the reach of Ignatius.
For this reason, therefore, besides several others, we
may understand why Ignatius paid such a high tribute
to this eminent man, when he said, as Ribadeneira
tells us, that "to no one of the first Fathers did the
Society owe more than to Laynez." Whereupon the
historian Sacchini observes: "This, I believe, he said
of Laynez, not only on account of the other eminent
merits of so great a man, and, in particular, for devising
or arranging the system of Colleges; but most
especially because the foundations, on which this
Order largely rests, were new, and therefore likely to
excite astonishment; and Laynez, having at command
the resources of a vast erudition, was the person to
confirm and commend them to public opinion. And
that this praise was deserved by Laynez will appear
less dubious to any one who considers that other
period also, during which he was himself General;
if one reckons how many points, as yet unshaped and
inceptive, in the management of the Society, were
reduced to form and perfected by Laynez; how widely
it was propagated and defended by <span class="locked">him."<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span></p>

<p>But to return to Ignatius. After ten years of government,
he gathered together in Rome such of the
first Fathers as could be had, besides representatives
from all the Provinces. Forty-seven members were
present. He submitted to them, in general assembly,
the Constitution as now drawn up, and as acted upon
in practical life, during those ten years. The Jesuits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
present did not exhaust the number of those whose
express opinions were desired. That not a single one
of the principal Fathers might be omitted in the deliberation,
he sent copies of the proposed code of laws
to such as were absent. With the suggestions and
approbations received from all these representative
men he was not yet content. Two more years had
elapsed when, having embodied the practical results of
an ever-widening experience, he undertook to promulgate
the Constitution, by virtue of the authority
vested in him for that purpose. But he only promulgated
the rule; he did not yet exercise his authority
to the full, and impose it as binding. He desired that
daily use might bring out still farther, how it felt
under the test of being tried, amid so many races and
nations. Thus 1553 came and went; and he waited,
until the whole matter should be revised and approved
once more by the entire Society in conclave. His
death intervened in 1556.</p>

<p>Two years later, representatives from the twelve
provinces of the Order met together, and elected
James Laynez as successor to Father Ignatius. Examining
once more this Constitution in all its parts,
receiving the whole of it just as it stood with absolute
unanimity, and with a degree of veneration, they
exercised the supreme authority of the Order, and
confirmed this as the written Constitution of the
Society of Jesus. By this act nothing was wanting
to it, even from the side of Papal authority. Yet, that
every plenitude of solemnity might be added to it, they
presented it to the Sovereign Pontiff, Paul IV, who
committed the code to four Cardinals for accurate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
revision. The commission returned it, without having
altered a word, From that time, whatever general
legislation has been added, has entered into the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">corpus
juris</i>, or "Institute" at large, as supplementing or
explaining the "Constitution," which remains the
fundamental instrument of the Institute.</p>

<p>In the Constitution there are ten parts. The fourth
is on studies. In length, this fourth part alone fills
up some twenty-eight out of one hundred and eleven
quarto pages in all, as it stands printed in the latest
Roman edition. The legislation about studies is thus
seen to be one-fourth of the whole. It has seventeen
chapters. In one of them, on the Method and Order
to be observed in treating the Sciences, the founder
observes that a number of points "will be treated of
separately, in some document approved by the General
Superior." This is the express warrant, contained
in the Constitution, for the future <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>,
or System of Studies in the Society of Jesus.
In the meantime, he legislates in a more general way.
And he begins with a subject pre-eminently dear to
him, the duty of gratitude. Since corporations are
notoriously forgetful, and therefore ungrateful, he
lays down in the first place the permanent duty of the
Order towards benefactors: then he continues with
other topics. They stand <span class="locked">thus:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Founders of Colleges; and Benefactors. The
Temporalities of Colleges. The Students or Scholastics,
belonging to the Society. The Care to be taken
of them, during the time of their Studies. The Learning
they are to acquire. The Assistance to be rendered
them in various ways, to ensure their success in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
studies. The Schools attached to the Colleges of the
Society, i.e. for external Students not belonging to the
Order. The Advancement of Scholastics, belonging to
the Order, in the Various Arts which can make them
useful to their Neighbor. The Withdrawal of them
from Studies. The Government of Colleges. On Admitting
the Control of Universities into the Society.
The Sciences to be taught in Universities of the
Society. The Method and Order to be observed in
treating the foregoing Sciences. The Books to be
selected as Standards. Courses and Degrees. What
concerns Good Morals. The Officials and Assistants in
Universities.</p>

<p>Reserving the pedagogic explanation for the next
part of this essay, I shall here sketch some of the
more general ideas running through the whole legislation
of Ignatius of Loyola; and, first, in the present
chapter, I shall begin with his idea of Colleges.</p>

<p>Choosing personal poverty as the basis on which to
rest this vast enterprise of education, he did not therefore
mean to carry on expensive works of zeal, without
the means of meeting the expense. Obviously, it is
one thing not to have means, as a personal property,
and therefore not to consume them on self; it is quite
another, to have them and to use them for the good of
others. The most self-denying men can use funds for
the benefit of others; and can do so the better, the more
they deny themselves. It was in this sense that, later
on in the century, Cardinal Allen recognized the labors
and needs of the English Jesuit, Robert Parsons, who
was the superior and companion of Edmund Campian,
the former a leading star of Oxford, the latter, also an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Oxford man, and, as Lord Burghley called him, "a
diamond" of England. Since Queen Elizabeth was not
benign enough to lend the Jesuits a little building-room
on English soil, but preferred to lend them a
halter at Tyburn, Parsons was engaged in founding
English houses of higher studies in France and Spain,
at Valladolid, Seville, Lisbon, Eu, and St. Omer.
Cardinal Allen sent a contribution to the constructive
Jesuit, writing, as he did so: "Apostolic men should
not only despise money; they should also have it."
And just in this sense was Ignatius himself a philosopher
of no utopian school. So we may examine, with
profit, the material and temporal conditions required
in his Institute, for the establishment of public
schools and universities. I shall endeavor to put
these principles together and in <span class="locked">order.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span></p>

<p>First, there should be a location provided with
buildings and revenues, not merely sufficient for the
present, but having reference to needful development.</p>

<p>Secondly, these material conditions include a reference
to the maintenance of the faculty. The means
must be provided to meet the daily necessities of the
actual Professors, with adequate assistance of lay
brothers belonging to the Order; also to support several
substitute Professors; besides, to carry on the
formation of men, who will take the places of the
present Professors, and so maintain the faculty as
perpetual; moreover, to "provide for some more
Scholastic Students of the Order, seeing that there are
so many occupied in the service and promotion of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
common weal." These conditions also include "a
church for conducting spiritual ministrations in the
service of <span class="locked">others."<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span></p>

<p>Carrying out this idea, Laynez, in 1564, promulgated
a rule or "Form regarding the acceptance of Colleges."
He laid down the conditions, on which alone
the Society would take in charge either a Latin
School, requiring a foundation for twenty Jesuits; or
a Lyceum, with fifty persons; or a University, with
<span class="locked">seventy.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> Twenty-four years later, Father Aquaviva
drew up a more complete and a final "Form," distributing
colleges into the three classes, the lowest, the
medium, and the highest. The lowest must have
provision made for professing in the departments of
Grammar, Humanities, Rhetoric, Languages, and a
course of Moral Theology;&mdash;fifty Jesuits to be
supported. The medium class of colleges consists of
those whose founders desire, in addition to all the
foregoing departments, a triennial course of Philosophy,
which begins each year anew; eighty persons
to be supported. The highest class is that of the
Studium Generale, or University, in which, besides the
above, there are professed Scholastic Theology, Sacred
Scripture, Hebrew; one hundred and twenty persons
to be provided for. However, the countries of the
Indies, as well as the northern countries of Europe,
were not, for the present, brought under this <span class="locked">ordinance.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
Thirdly, the locality is to be such that, in the ordinary
course of events, there should be no prospective likelihood
of a deficiency in the concourse of students, and
those of the right kind. As, on the side of the Jesuit
Province, its educational forces are kept at least equal
to the posts which it has undertaken to fill, so, on the
side of the population, the prospect should correspond
to this undertaking, and give assurance of filling the
courses. Hence it was only in larger cities or towns
that Ignatius contemplated the foundation of colleges;
as the distich has it, contrasting the different fields of
activity chosen by different orders in the <span class="locked">Church:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">

</div></div>
</div>

<p>That is to say, "The monks of Clairvaux loved their
valleys; the Benedictines their mountain-tops; the
Franciscans the rural towns; Ignatius the great cities."</p>

<p>This was the more obviously his idea, as we find
him reluctantly granting permission for ministerial
excursions through a country, if thereby the Fathers'
influence in a great city be likely to suffer. He
writes to Father Kessel, the Rector at Cologne, where
as yet the Society had no college of its own, that
"under the circumstances he approves of Kessel's
making a short excursion through the province, provided
he and his companions are not long absent
from the city, and do not sacrifice the main thing to
what is accessory; but he does not give them permission
to fix their abode out of the town, because
places of less importance afford fewer occasions of
gathering the desired fruit: and, besides, they must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
not leave so famous a university; their exertions will
be more useful for the good of religion, in forming
scholars to become priests and officers of the State,
than all the pains they may bestow on the small
towns and <span class="locked">villages."<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> Again, when in 1547 he had
accepted the donation of a church, buildings, and
gardens at Tivoli from Louis Mendosa, he found the
place not suited to the convenience of scholars; it
was too near Rome, and yet too far; subsequently,
the institution had to be transferred within the <span class="locked">city."<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span></p>

<p>Fourthly, in addition to these material and local
conditions for the normal conduct of colleges, it is
supposed that the external relations of political society
are so far favorable, as at least to tolerate freedom
of action on the part of this educational Institute.
Such toleration was, as a general rule, not only the
least that could be asked for, but the most that was
enjoyed.</p>

<p>These are the chief conditions, material and temporal,
which Ignatius requires. They give him a
footing to commence his work, and allow the animating
principles of his Institute to come into play. The
animating principles, to which I refer, may be reduced
to three brief heads: First, an intellectual and moral
scope, clearly defined, as I shall explain in the following
chapters. Secondly, the distinct intention to promote
rather the interests of public and universal order
and enlightenment, than a mere local good of any city,
country, province. Thirdly, a tendency in the intellectual
institution itself to become rather a great one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
than a small one, with more degrees of instruction,
more and more eminent Professors, a greater number
of the right kind of <span class="locked">scholars.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span></p>

<p>As to the forces available for all this, and the proportion
of colleges to be manned in perpetuity, the
mind of Ignatius was most express, and became more
fixed from day to day. "Cut your cloak according to
your cloth," he said to Oliver Manare, when the latter,
on going to establish a college at Loretto, asked
how he should distribute his men. Ignatius preferred
to refuse Princes and Bishops their requests, excusing
himself on the score of limited resources, than compromise
the reputation of the Society, by an ill-advised
<span class="locked">assent.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> And he said, as Polanco his secretary
tells us, that "if anything ought to make him wish
to live a longer time, it was that he might be severe
in admitting men into the <span class="locked">Order."<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> He did not want
to have many members in the Society; still less, too
many engagements.</p>

<p>Having stated thus briefly the material conditions
required by Ignatius, and the animating principles
or motives which determined him, we are in a position
to discern more distinctly the central object
of his attention, that for which the material conditions
were provided, that by which the ultimate objects
were to be attained. It was the teaching body, the
faculty, the "College," properly so called. The
"College" was the body of educators who were sent
to a place. For them the material conditions did but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
supply a local habitation, subsistence, books, apparatus.
The very first decree quoted by Pachtler, from
the first general assembly, uses the term "College"
in this sense: "No college is to be <i>sent</i> to any place,"
<span class="locked">etc.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span></p>

<p>It is only by derivation from this meaning that the
term is applied to the buildings and appointments.
It is the body of men that makes the institution. It
is this also which makes the institution perpetual;
and therefore must itself be so; and must have the
material conditions provided for continuing itself, by
means of a constant stream of younger men under
formation, who will perpetuate the same work.</p>

<p>Now it would be an ideal conception of practical
life to be looking for virtuous and erudite men, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">viri
boni simul et eruditi</i>, as Ignatius calls them, ever
pouring into the Order, straight from the chairs of
universities, from benefices, and posts of leisured
ease; and, armed already with the full equipment of
intellectual and moral endowments, presenting themselves
and their services thenceforth, under the title
of absolute poverty, to cities, provinces, and countries,
which never had anything to do with their formation.
"These men," says Ignatius, "are found to be few in
number, and of these few the majority would prefer to
rest, after so many labors already undergone. We
apprehend that it will be difficult for this Society to
grow, on the mere strength of those who are already
both good and accomplished, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">boni simul ac literati</i>; and
this for two reasons, the great labors which this manner
of life imposes, and the great self-abnegation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
needed. Therefore, ... another way has seemed
good to adopt, that of admitting young men, who, by
their good lives and their talents afford us ground to
hope that they will grow up into virtuous and learned
men, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in probos simul ac doctos viros</i>; of admitting also
colleges, on those conditions which are expressed in
the Apostolic briefs, whether these colleges be within
universities, or independent: and, if within universities,
whether these institutions themselves are committed
to the care of the Society, or not.... Wherefore,
we shall first speak of the colleges; then of the
universities," <span class="locked">etc.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span></p>

<p>There were never wanting men of the former kind,
already accomplished and of tried virtue, who offered
themselves for this service of a lifetime. A noteworthy
testimony to their numbers may be found in a
dispute with Philip II of Spain, who objected to any
moneys leaving the Jesuit Provinces of his realm, for
the service and maintenance of the great central college
in Rome; and this, notwithstanding the fact that
Spanish members were being maintained and formed
there. The general assembly, gathered in Rome,
1565, discussed the difficulty; and one of the circumstances
mentioned was this: "The Provinces of Spain
did not need the assistance of the Roman College as
much as others; since many entered the Society,
already mature in age and accomplished in learning,
so that they could be employed at once in public positions;
nor had they to be taught, but they were able
to teach others.... It was finally recommended
that, to lessen the burden of expense on the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
College, and in order that fewer scholastics need be
called to Rome, each Province, as soon as convenient,
should organize a general university; especially as
there was already a sufficiency of students (members
of the Order) and, besides, of <span class="locked">Professors."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> This was
only twenty-six years after the foundation of the
Society.</p>

<p>But, even with all the advantages accruing from
these large contingents of learned men already formed,
the idea of Ignatius, to train young men within the
Order, was more practical for the formation of faculties;
and it carried the general efficiency much further.
Powerful and effective as the most pronounced personalities
may be, when each striking character goes forward
into the open field of battle and leads the way,
they are not more powerful than when also qualified
to move in the steady and regular march of the
trained forces. Father Montmorency, referring to
the strength which comes of uniformity, sociability,
and harmony, said, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Homo unus, homo nullus</i>, "A man
alone is as good as no man at all."</p>

<p>Ignatius then, having perpetuity and development
in view, and therefore the steady and trained development
of talented and virtuous young men, would
not accept foundations, except on the basis of endowment,
just described. He had not learned in vain the
lessons of Barcelona, Alcalà, Salamanca, and Paris.
How wisely he acted is shown by the troubles, which
later legislation reveals, upon this very point of inadequately
endowed colleges. The questions of ill-endowed
colleges, small colleges, too many colleges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
for the forces of a Province, are all excellently discussed
and settled in the general assembly, which, in
1565, elected Francis Borgia to succeed Laynez. And
"on the same day," says Sacchini, "the Fathers set
the example of observing the decree which they had
just made, with the same degree of severity with
which they had made it; for, the letters of several
Bishops and municipalities being read, in which foundations
for five colleges were offered, they decided
that no one of them should be admitted; and, besides,
they gave the new General full authority to dissolve
certain colleges already <span class="locked">existing."<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span> In a similar vein,
this was the theme of an elegant apology delivered
before King Stephen by Father Campano, Provincial
of Poland, who requested the King to desist from
urging on the Society the multiplication of its <span class="locked">institutions.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span></p>

<p>A tuition-fee paid by the scholar to the Professor,
or to the institution, was nowhere contemplated. At
Dijon, where Bossuet was afterwards a pupil, the
magistrates when offering a college, in 1603, desired
to supplement an inadequate endowment, by requiring
a fee from the students. In the name of the Order,
Father Coton, the King's confessor, remonstrated; and
Henri IV himself wrote to the Parliament of Bourgogne,
desiring another arrangement to be made; which
was accordingly <span class="locked">done.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> The foundation was always
to be received as a gratuitous donation, for which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Order owed permanent gratitude. In turn, thenceforward,
it gave gratuitously, and allowed of no
recompense. "No obligations or conditions are to be
admitted that would impair the integrity of our principle,
which is: To give gratuitously, what we have
received <span class="locked">gratis."<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span></p>

<p>Thus then the faculty, a competent and a permanent
one, is installed. It is not one conspicuous for
leisured ease. Professors and Scholastics alike are
working for a purpose. They are a "college," in the
sense of the Society of Jesus. Yet, if there is not
leisured ease, but a life of work and self-denial, the
system has been found to result in all the consequences
which may be looked for in literary "ease
with dignity"; and perhaps in more, since no one
does more, than he who, in his own line, has as much
as he can well do, and do well. System and method,
the great means for making time manifold, become so
absolutely necessary; and the singleness of intention
in a religious life intensifies results. Then, after the
general formation has been bestowed, in the consecutive
higher studies of seven or nine years within the
Order, the plan of Ignatius leaves open to individual
talents the whole field of specialties, in Science and
Literature. Hence, to speak of our own day, Secchi
or Perry devotes himself to astronomy, Garucci to
archæology, Strassmeyer to Oriental inscriptions, the
De Backers and Sommervogel to bibliography, others
to philology, mathematics, and the natural sciences;
while five hundred and more writers follow the lines
of their own inclinations, either for some directly useful
purpose, or because their pursuit is in itself liberal.</p>

<p>What was the response of the Christian world,
when it had become alive to the nature of this new
power in its midst, and to the proposal which the new
power made? What did the answer come to, in the
way of providing temporalities, necessary and sufficient?
Strange enough! Loyola's own short official
lifetime of fifteen years does not appear to have been
too short, for the purpose of awakening the world with
his idea; which, like a two-edged sword of his own
make, not only aroused the keenest opposition at every
thrust, and at his every onward step, but opened numberless
resources in the apostolic, the charitable, and
educational reserves of human nature.</p>

<p>This man, who had inserted in the authentic formula
and charter of his Institute that watchword of
his movements, "Defence and Advance"; who had
taken the whole world for the field of his operations,
in defending and advancing; this cavalier of a new
military type, who had only to show himself upon the
field to gather around him the flower of youth as well
as mature age, from college and university, from doctor's
chair and prince's throne, left behind him, as the
work of fifteen years from the foundation of the Order,
about one hundred colleges and houses, distributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
into twelve Provinces. The territorial divisions were
named, after their chief centres, the Provinces of
Portugal, Castile, Andalusia, Aragon, Italy, Naples,
Sicily, Upper Germany, Lower Germany, France,
Brazil, and the East Indies. Individuals under his
orders had overrun Ireland, penetrated into Scotland,
into Congo, Abyssinia, and Ethiopia. The East Indies,
first traversed by Francis Xavier either on foot,
or in unseaworthy vessels, signified the whole stretch
of countries from Goa and Ceylon on the West, to
Malacca, Japan, and the coast of China on the East.
Some of this activity might be credited to apostolic
zeal alone, were it not that, wherever the leaders advanced
into the heart of a new country, it was always
with the purpose, and generally with the result, that
the country was to be occupied with educational institutions.
De Backer notes this in another connection,
when, in the preface to his great work of bibliography,
"The Library of Writers of the Company of Jesus,"
he says: "Wherever a Jesuit set his foot, wherever
there was founded a house, a college, a mission, there
too arose apostles of another class, who labored, who
taught, who <span class="locked">wrote."<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span></p>

<p>What this means, with regard to its strategic value,
there is no need of our being told. The Duke of
Parma, writing, in 1580, from the seat of war in the
Netherlands to Philip II of Spain, said: "Your Majesty
desired that I should build a citadel in Maestricht;
I thought that a college of the Jesuits would
be a fortress more likely to protect the inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
against the enemies of the Altar and the Throne. I
have built <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span></p>

<p>Sixty years later, after the long generalship of
Aquaviva, who during 34 years governed the Order
with the ability of another Ignatius, the number of
colleges was 372. Well might his immediate successor,
Mutius Vitelleschi, writing to the whole Society
about the Education of Youth, speak of the "beautiful
and precious mass of gold, which we have in our
hands to form and <span class="locked">finish."<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span></p>

<p>One hundred and fifty years after the death of
Ignatius, the collegiate and university houses of education
numbered 769. Two hundred years after the
same date, when the Order was on the verge of universal
suppression, under the action of University men,
Parliamentarians, Jansenists, Philosophers, and of that
new movement which was preparing the Revolution,
the Jesuit educational institutions stood at the figure,
728. The colleges covered almost the whole world,
distributed into 39 Provinces, besides 172 Missions
in the less organized regions of the <span class="locked">globe.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span></p>

<p>If we look at these 700 institutions of secondary
and superior education, under the aspect of their
constitution, that is to say, of their scope, their system,
the supreme legislative and executive power
which characterized them, we find that they were not
so much a plurality of institutions, as a single one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Take the 92 colleges of France <span class="locked">alone.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> In one
sense, these may be considered as less united than
the 50 colleges of the Paris University, for the
Paris University was in one quarter of a city, which
offers a material unity; these, on the contrary, were
spread over the whole of France, presenting the characteristics
of "national" education; just as the 700
were over the whole world, a cosmopolitan system.
But, regarded in their formal and essential bond,
they were vastly more of a unit, as an identical educational
power, than any faculty existing. No faculty,
whether at Paris or Salamanca, Rome or Oxford, ever
possessed that control over its 50, 20, or even 8 colleges,
which each Provincial Superior exercised over
his 10, 20, or 30, and the General over more than 700,
with 22,126 members in the Order. In the one General
lay the power of an active headship; from him
the facultative power of conferring degrees emanated;
and he had one system of studies and discipline
in his charge to administer, with a latitude
of discretion according to times, places, and circumstances.</p>

<p>As to the numbers of students, and the general
estimate to be formed of them, I will record such
data as fall under the eye, while passing rapidly
over the literature of the subject.</p>

<p>In Rome, the 20 colleges attending the classes
of the Roman College numbered, in 1584, 2108 students.
Father Argento, in his apology to the States
at Klausenburg, in 1607, mentions that the schools in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Transylvania were frequented by the flower of the
nobility; and, in his "History of the Affairs in
Poland," dedicated to Sigismund III, he attests that
from 8000 to 10,000 youths, chiefly of the nobility
and gentry, frequented the gymnasia of the Order in
Poland. At Rouen, in France, there were regularly
2000. At La Flèche there were 1700 during a century;
300 being boarders, the other 1400 finding accommodation
in the village, but always remaining
under the supervision of the faculty. Throughout
the seventeenth century, the numbers at the College
of Louis-le-Grand, in Paris, varied between 2000,
1827, and 3000; including, in the latter number, 550
boarders. In 1627, only a few years after the restoration
of the Society by Henri IV, the one Province
of Paris had, in its 14 colleges, 13,195 students;
which would give an average of nearly 1000 to a college.
Cologne almost began with 800 students,&mdash;its
roll in 1558. Dilingen in 1607 had 760; in its <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictus</i>,
110 of the boarders were Religious, besides
other Ecclesiastics; the next year, out of 250 <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictores</i>
or boarders, 118 were Religious of various Orders,
the secular Priesthood being represented among the
students generally. At Utrecht, during the first century
of the Order's existence, there were 1000 scholars;
at Antwerp and Brussels each, 600; in most of the Belgian
colleges, 300. As to Spain and Italy, which first
saw the Society rise in their midst, and expand with
immense vigor all over them, I consider it superfluous
to dwell particularly upon them.</p>

<p>In many of the capitals and important centres
throughout Europe, there were separate colleges for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
nobles. Elsewhere the nobility were mixed with the
rest; thus 400 nobles and more were attending the
Jesuit schools in Paris. It was studiously aimed at
by the Order to eliminate, in matters of education, all
distinguishing marks or privileges. Thus Father Buys
endeavors, in 1610, to reduce the practice at Dilingen
to the custom of the other colleges in the upper German
<span class="locked">Province.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span></p>

<p>Most of the Papal Seminaries founded by Gregory
XIII, at Vienna, Dilingen, Fulda, Prague, Gratz,
Olmütz, Wilna, as well as in Japan and other countries,
were put under the direction of the Society; as
Pius IV did with his Roman Seminary; and St.
Charles Borromeo with that of Milan.</p>

<p>Not knowing what the absolute average really was
in these 700 institutions, we may still form some idea
of what the sum total of students must have been
at its lowest figure. For this purpose, we can take
an average which seems about the lowest possible.
I have not met with any distinct mention of a college
having less than 300 scholars. There are indeed frequent
complaints in the general assemblies, regarding
what are denounced as "small" colleges. However,
it seems clear from numerous indications, as, for
instance, from the Encyclical letter of the General
Paul <span class="locked">Oliva,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> that these colleges were called small,
not primarily on account of an insufficient number
of students, but because of insufficient foundations,
which did not support the Professors actually employed.
A document for the Rectors notes that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
"thus far almost all the colleges, even such as have
received endowments, suffer want regularly, and have
frequently to borrow <span class="locked">money."<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span></p>

<p>Hence we may be allowed to take, as a tentative
average, 300 students to a college. At once, we rise
to a sum total of more than 200,000 students in these
collegiate and university grades, all being formed at a
given date under one system of studies and of government,
intellectual and moral.</p>

<p>If statistics, in that nicely tabulated form which
delights modern bureaus, have failed us as we run
over the whole world to decipher the indications,
there is yet another view which we may catch of the
same subject, and one that is equally valuable. It is
the multitude of nations into which this educational
growth ramified. At Goa, in Hindustan, the seminary,
which was inferior to none in Europe, had for
its students, Brahmins, Persians, Arabians, Ethiopians,
Armenians, Chaldeans, Malabari, Cananorii, Guzarates,
Dacanii, and others from the countries beyond
the Ganges. Japan had its colleges at Funai, Arima,
Anzuchzana, and Nangasaki. China had a college at
Macao; and later on many more, reaching into the
interior, where the Fathers became the highest mandarins
in the service of the Emperor, and built his
observatory. Towards the close of the eighteenth
century a large number of colleges were flourishing
in Central and South America. All of these disappeared,
when the Order was suppressed. The youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
who could afford to obtain the education needed, went
over to Europe, whence they returned, a generation
quite different from what had been known of before.
They returned with the principles of the Revolution.
And the whole history of Central and South America
has changed, from that date onwards, into a series of
revolutions, which are the standing marvel of political
scientists to our day.</p>

<p>To consult a graphic representation of how this educational
Order looked on the map of the world, one
may glance into the ninth volume of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Monumenta
Germaniæ Pædagogica</i>. There Father Pachtler, as in
his other volumes of the series, sketches only the German
"Assistency" of the Society of Jesus. The five
Assistencies of the Order served the purposes of government,
by grouping many Provinces together into
larger divisions. In 1725, the German Assistency
comprised nine out of thirty-two Provinces. The nine
in question are those of Flandro-Belgium, French
Belgium, the Lower Rhine, the Upper Rhine, Upper
Germany, Bohemia, Austria, Poland, Lithuania. The
map at the end of Father Pachtler's volume represents
all this country, with the towns marked differently,
according as they contained either universities
of the Order, or colleges, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictus</i>, that is, boarding-colleges,
or seminaries, or residences. The chronological
order of their rise is presented in a table at the
beginning of the same volume, with a note to indicate
more in particular the grade or amplitude of each, as
being a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Studium Generale</i>, otherwise called University
or Academy, a College or a Gymnasium, as well as
the annexes of each, in the shape of one or more <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictus</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
one or more Episcopal or Papal Seminaries,
a college of nobles, a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictus</i> for poor scholars. By
means of this map, a graphic presentation is afforded
of one Assistency, from which, by a proper extension,
the whole world may be portrayed to the imagination.
In 1750, within the limits of this map, there were 217
colleges, 55 seminaries, 73 residences, 24 novitiates,
160 missions, 6 professed <span class="locked">houses.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span></p>

<p>The universities here spoken of, otherwise called
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Studia Generalia</i>, or Academies, are quite typical, a
special Jesuit development of the mediæval style.
An exact and official form, drawn up for the University
of Gratz, may be found in the same <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Monumenta</i>.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
As Father Pachtler remarks, it shows at a glance the
inner working of a Jesuit university, and the general
system prevailing over the whole Society. He entitles
the document: "<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Ordnung einer ausschlieschlich
von Jesuiten geleiteten Universität</i>," or "<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Einer selbständige
Universität, 1658</i>." The Latin title is: "<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Forma et
Ratio Gubernandi Academias et Studia Generalia S.&nbsp;J.</i>"
It was the compilation of Father John Argento.</p>

<p>Upon this basis of the amount of work done, as
well as its intrinsic character, shown by the results,
I was going to draw some inferences with regard to
the amount of the temporal endowments, which must
have been required to support such a vast organization,
and must have been vested in the Order by the
Christian world. One might compare the work done
with what Oxford accomplishes; and, seeing that the
latter university supplies the facilities for higher education,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
and that far from gratuitously, to only a couple
of thousands among the nobility and gentry, then,
since it spends upon this an annual revenue of $2,500,000,
how much would be required to conduct the education
of a quarter of a million of students? Our
arithmetic would feel oppressed by the calculation.</p>

<p>But the calculation is not necessary. It is quite
evident that religious poverty gave the key to the
situation,&mdash;poverty, self-abnegation, the resignation
of all temporal considerations in life, by men who had
no families to provide for, no station to acquire; who
had themselves given up every station, from that of
the clerical benefice, or the liberal and martial careers,
to ducal coronets, princedoms, and even royalty; men
therefore, who were bestowing with themselves, and in
themselves, the essential endowment of education upon
the world, and who needed only to have that supplemented
with the few temporal necessities still remaining.
And the conclusion to be drawn seems to be this.
The Christian world, whether ruler or people, republic
or municipality, was making a safe and lucrative investment,
whether at home or abroad, in the midst of
civilization or of barbarism, when it consigned the absolute
use of sufficient temporalities to a world-wide
faculty, inspired by the sentiment of religious devotion.</p>

<p>For what is the object of any religious society whatsoever?
It is to complete in each of its members the
duties of the man, the citizen and the Christian, with
other duties called "religious," which, correlative
with the former, are nevertheless distinct from them.
They are duties which presuppose the moral virtues,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the civil and Christian virtues, and tend to complete
them with the highest qualities to which perfect Christianity
aspires, those of self-devotion and religious
self-consecration.</p>

<p>Hence the experiences, making a drama and a
tragedy, when the Society abruptly disappeared.
Supposing even that enough of competent men, with
all personal requirements, could have been found to
fill the void, what of their salaries and support?
Take an instance. The revenues, which at Bourges
had been enough for the support of thirty Jesuits,
were found, after the Suppression of the Order, not to
afford an adequate compensation for ten secular <span class="locked">Professors.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></span>
Frederic II of Prussia, sending an agent to
negotiate with Pius VI about retaining the Order in
his States, expresses himself thus in a letter to Voltaire:
"The surest means (to perpetuate a series of
Professors) is to preserve a seminary of men destined
to teach. In studying the sciences, they fit themselves
for the office of instructing. It would be no
easy task to fill instantaneously a vacancy left by a
skilful professor. If the education of ordinary citizens
be necessary, the training up of instructors must
be no less so." And then, coming to the point before
us, the King continues: "Besides, there are reasons
of economy for preferring such a body of men to mere
secular individuals. The professor taken from the
latter class will cost more, because he has a greater
number of wants. It is needless to remark that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
property of the Jesuits would not be sufficient to remunerate
their successors; and that revenues, which
pass over to the administration of the government,
always suffer <span class="locked">diminution."<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></span> Speaking of Ganganelli,
Pope Clement XIII, who was under pressure from
various quarters to make him suppress the Order,
Frederic writes to Voltaire in 1770: "For my own
part, I have no reason to complain of him; he leaves
me my dear Jesuits, whom they are persecuting everywhere.
I will save the precious seed, to give some of
it, one day, to those who should wish to cultivate a
plant so <span class="locked">rare."<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></span></p>

<p>The testimony of documents is uniform upon the
poverty of these men, whom Protestant historians like
Grotius, Robertson, and others marvel at, for the authority
they possessed in the world, for the purity of
their lives, their success in teaching, and their art of
commanding with wisdom as they themselves obeyed
with fidelity. Their life was one of straitened circumstances
and self-abnegation. We may see it illustrated
in <span class="locked">Dilingen.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></span> Or again, at the great royal college,
founded by Henri IV at La Flèche, where three hundred
boarders were supposed to be paying their own
expenses, as <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pensionnaires</i>, we find Louis XIII issuing
a royal decree that his magistrates are to prosecute
"les rétardataires et les récalcitrants par toutes
les voyes raisonnables," persons who did not pay the
expenses of their own children, but left that interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
occupation to the college. With all that, says
Rochemonteix, nothing came of it, neither of the royal
injunctions, nor of judicial suits; things went on the
same way, "the parents paying badly, and the treasurers
<span class="locked">lamenting."<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></span></p>

<p>I will close this chapter with one case, because it
serves to emphasize a particular sequel of the Suppression;
that is, the revival of a tuition-fee. A recent
author, writing in 1890, tells the history of the College
of Saint-Yves at Vannes, in Brittany. He sums
up its revenues at 6000 livres. Placed in the hands
of the Order, this college, in 1636, that is, seven years
after the Society had assumed charge, directed 400
students; later on, 900; and then 1200. In 1762, the
faculty consisted of thirteen members, besides the
four Fathers engaged in the adjoining house of retreats.
All rendered various services, as is usual in a
college of Jesuit instructors. To these we must add
the requisite complement of the faculty, at least half
as many more lay assistants, belonging to the Order,
and to the same local community. Here then are
twenty-two at the least, subsisting on 6000 livres a
year; and meanwhile providing their house, their
library, their physical cabinet, which was fully fitted
up with all necessary instruments, and their <span class="locked">observatory.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></span>
"The moment after the Suppression," he goes
on to say, "it was quite another affair! Ten secular
professors cost 11,000 livres for their salaries alone!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
The author gives the list of their salaries. "To reëstablish
equilibrium, one of the first acts of the parliament
was to exact from each scholar a tuition-fee of
twelve livres; and yet they complained, they could
not make ends meet."</p>

<p>Observe, a tuition-fee! On the day after the Suppression,
they begin to undo the very work, which,
two hundred and thirty years before, the Order had
begun to do at its birth, spreading education gratuitously,
without drawing on pupils, or drawing on the
public treasury.</p>

<p>Well might the General Vincent Caraffa say, in
the time of the Thirty Years' War, "We abound
rather in men than in revenues." And he says so, in
the same breath and in the same sentence, in which
he is asking Priests to offer themselves for life to the
work of teaching the lower branches, a work which
he calls laborious, in times which he specifies as
disastrous, and in circumstances which he describes
as having no provision made for the means of <span class="locked">living.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></span></p>

<p>This brief sketch will go to show how the Christian
world did, indeed, meet the proposal of the Order,
and found seven hundred colleges. But it also shows
how the Order endowed the world, and had even to
make good, with its personal heroism, the defects in
many of the foundations.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE INTELLECTUAL SCOPE AND METHOD PROPOSED.</span></h2>

<p>As the second part of this book is intended to be a
pedagogic analysis of the mental culture imparted, I
need not sketch here, save in a general way, the intellectual
scope proposed by Ignatius of Loyola, and
the method which he originated. Both scope and
method vary somewhat, according as the students
contemplated are respectively external to the Order,
or members of it. The latter are to be qualified for
becoming future Professors, even though, in point of
fact, only a certain proportion of them become so.</p>

<p>Studious youth in general, including Ecclesiastics
and Religious of the various Orders, are considered
by Ignatius as distributed amid two kinds of educational
institutions. One of these he calls the Public
School; the other, a University. The first is that
which extends, in its courses, from the rudiments of
literature up to the lower level of university education.
He says: "Where it can conveniently be
done, let Public Schools be opened, at least in the
departments of Humane <span class="locked">Letters."<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></span> In a note, he
explains that Moral Theology may be treated in a
gymnasium of this kind. Father Aquaviva, in 1588,
puts this kind of school down as the lowest of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
ranks of colleges; and sums up the courses as being
those of Grammar, Humanities, Rhetoric, Languages,
and Moral <span class="locked">Theology.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></span> He also explains why the
lowest Jesuit curriculum must fill these requirements,
"in order that the Society be not defrauded of
the end it has in view, which is, to carry the students
on at least as far as mediocrity in learning, so that
they may go forth into their respective vocations,
Ecclesiastics to their ministry, lay students to their
own work in life, qualified in some degree with a
sufficiency of literary <span class="locked">culture."<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></span> This curriculum
served also the purpose of those, who, while members
of the Order, were for some reason dispensed from
the full course of <span class="locked">studies.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></span> If any grades are wanting
in a college, it must be the lower ones which are
omitted, the higher being <span class="locked">retained.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></span> Ignatius goes
on to limit the courses in a gymnasium of this kind:
"Let not higher sciences be treated here; but, to
pursue them, the students who have made due
progress in literature are to be sent from these colleges
to the <span class="locked">universities.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></span></p>

<p>Passing on to universities of the Order, he defines
for their scope, first, in behalf of those who are to be
Ecclesiastics, Scholastic Theology, Holy Scripture, and
Positive Theology; secondly, for all students, Humane
Letters, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and other such
languages as Chaldaic, Arabic, and Indian, subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the demands of necessity or utility; moreover, Logic,
Physics, Metaphysics, Moral Philosophy, and Mathematics.
All these departments are to be provided
for by Professors of the Order. If the departments
of Civil Law and Medicine are added, they will be
conducted by Professors not of the <span class="locked">Society.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></span></p>

<p>As to the Scholastic members of the Society, their
mental culture in the Order begins, of course, where
their collegiate curriculum had closed, that is, at the
end of their classical course. Their studies henceforth
are defined by two objects; one, that of professing,
as formed Jesuits in the future, what they
are studying now; the other, that of being differentiated,
according to talent and circumstance, into
preachers, writers, directors of consciences, or managers
of affairs.</p>

<p>In view of this two-fold object, all the examinations,
arranged for members of the Order in the
advanced courses, are regulated by one standard, that
the Jesuit Scholastics must be found competent, at
each stage, to teach the course in which they are
being tested. Accordingly, they review their previous
literary acquirements, in all the lines which the Society
regularly professes; then, during three years,
they apply exclusively to Philosophy and Natural
Sciences; and, four years more, to Divinity and allied
<span class="locked">Sciences.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></span></p>

<p>This protracted course, therefore, as given more in
detail by the subsequent <i>Ratio</i>, consists of Poetry,
Rhetoric, and Literature; Mathematics, Physics, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Chemistry; Logic, Ontology, Cosmology, Psychology,
and Natural Theology; Ethics, Natural, Social and
Public Right, Moral Theology, Canon Law, Ecclesiastical
History, Scholastic Theology, Hebrew, Sacred
Scripture. The courses are to be pursued either in
the same classes which external students attend, or,
in their own university classes, when a general house
of studies is formed as a "Scholasticate." In both
cases, they have Seminary exercises of their own,
beyond what is required in the most condensed university
courses.</p>

<p>Those whom health and excellence have approved
at every step are ordinarily to be withdrawn from
studies, "when the course of Arts has been finished,
and when four years have been spent on <span class="locked">Theology."<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></span>
Specialties are to be <span class="locked">cultivated.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></span> Subsequent legislation
places these specialties in the interval between
the Arts and Theology; and, again, after the latter.</p>

<p>This, in brief, is the practical idea of the Professorial
Seminaries, philological, philosophical, scientific,
and theological, through which the stream of future
Professors is continually passing. Each one is subject,
at every stage, to examination tests which include
the most distinct reference to professorial capacity.
The technical standard in the examinations is
that of "surpassing mediocrity," which term is accurately
defined, as we shall see later, when analyzing
the <i>Ratio</i>.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>While the depleted ranks of the professorial body
are thus regularly supplied, it is clear that more services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
remain available in the Order at large, than the
single purpose of education would at any time require.
But this only serves the wider scope which
the Society has in view, much wider than education
taken alone. And Ignatius makes mention of this
expressly when he says, that the Scholastic students
"may never come to profess the learning which they
have acquired"; still "they are to consider that labor
of studies as a work of great merit in the sight of
<span class="locked">God."<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></span></p>

<p>So much for the widest and highest intellectual objects
aimed at in these studies. Looking down now
to its lowest limit, we perceive that education, as
imparted by the Society to the external world, is to
begin not below "the rudiments of grammar, in
which boys must already be versed; they must know
how to read and write; nor is any allowance to be
made in favor of any one, whatever be his condition
of life; but those who press these petitions upon us
are to be answered, that we are not permitted" to
teach the elements. This is the ordinance of Aquaviva,
in 1592, and he simply refers to the <span class="locked">Constitution.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></span>
He also notes, in the same document, that the
new <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i> elevates every grade, as it stood
at that date, one year higher than it had been before.
The document is from the German archives. Pachtler
observes that most of the Latin schools, particularly
in Protestant Germany, took children up from the
<span class="locked">alphabet.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></span> The effect of the Jesuit system was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
of a constant upward trend to what was higher, more
systematic, and complete.</p>

<p>This brings us to the question of method. Here a
number of elements occur, some of them essential,
many of them subordinate. These latter, at least, were
the products of ingenuity and industry on the part of
the teaching body, and were productive of industry
and life on the part of scholars. To illustrate the
whole matter, I will refer to authors who were addressing
the world, soon after the Society had taken
its stand as an educational power, and when its institutions
were conspicuous to the eyes of all.</p>

<p>First comes classification, which was an essential
feature of the Jesuit system. Ribadeneira, the intimate
friend of Ignatius, when writing the life of
Loyola, in the year 1584, and describing the work of
the Order, now forty-fours years old, observes: "Elsewhere
one Professor has many grades of scholars before
him; he addresses himself at one and the same time
to scholars who are at the bottom, midway, and at the
top; and he can scarcely meet the demands of each.
But, in the Society, we distinguish one rank of
scholars from another, dividing them into their own
classes and orders; and separate Professors are placed
over <span class="locked">each."<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></span></p>

<p>The division of classes, a thing so natural to us,
was in those times a novelty. There were practically
only two degrees of teaching; one superior, embracing
Theology, Law, and Medicine; the other preparatory.
The preparatory instruction had already been
tending towards the later system of grading; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
term "class" was an expression of the Renaissance.
Father Rochemonteix, speaking of the Paris University,
notes that the first authentic act, in which the
term is used, dates from <span class="locked">1539.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></span> From 1535, the division
of studies, by means of classes, was already being
accomplished. Still there was no definite number of
grades. The study of literary models was defective.
Grammar was beclouded with the subtleties of dialectics,
to the great prejudice of written composition, as
well as of the reading and imitation of <span class="locked">models.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></span></p>

<p>Now it will be observed that Ignatius was studying
in the University of Paris from 1528 to 1535; and his
companions remained till 1536. By the time he published
the Constitution as a rule of guidance, he had
become surrounded by men, who were not merely
graduates of universities, but had been Doctors, Professors,
and Rectors in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy,
Belgium, Germany. One consequence was that Ignatius,
from the very beginning, formulated a complete
system of graded classes. He relegated dialectics to
its proper field, Philosophy and Theology. And, bringing
into prominence the reading of authors, and the
practice of style in imitation of the best models, he
defined a method. This, after being elaborated during
forty years, was then found to be not only new, but
complete, and good for centuries to come. It arranged
courses in a series, having reference to one another;
it coördinated definite stages of the courses with definite
matter to be seen; and, in the lower branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
it distributed the students, with their respective portions
of the matter, into five grades, classifying precepts,
authors, and exercises, as proportioned to each
successive grade. Nothing more familiar to ourselves
now; nothing newer to the world then! This was the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>.</p>

<p>The grades of the gymnasium may include several
divisions, according to the number of students; but
the grading itself remains fixed, and leaves no element,
either of actual culture, or of future developments,
unprovided for, or without a location. Nor do
these grades mean five years. They mean a work to
be done in each grade, before the next is taken up.
On this, the mind of Ignatius was most explicit. As an
almost universal rule, they never mean less than five
years. And, for one of them, the grade of Rhetoric,
in which all literary perfection is to be acquired, the
system contemplates two and even three years. In
this point, too, we may note a characteristic view of
Ignatius. It is that the longer term, whenever provided,
whenever prescribed, urged, and insisted upon,
is always for the talented student, the one who is to
become eminent. To use his own words, when laying
down the rules in this matter for the Rector of a
University, his full idea will be carried out, when
"those who are of the proper age, and have the
aptitude of genius, endeavor to succeed in every
branch and to be <i>conspicuous therein</i>."<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>To enumerate now some of the subordinate elements
in the Jesuit method, I will quote from the same
author, Ribadeneira. He says, speaking of young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
scholars: "Many means are devised, and exercises employed,
to stimulate the minds of the young&mdash;assiduous
disputation, various trials of genius, prizes offered
for excellence in talent and industry. These prerogatives
and testimonies of virtue vehemently arouse the
minds of students, awake them even when sleeping,
and, when they are aroused and are running on with a
good will, impel them and spur them on faster. For,
as penalty and disgrace bridle the will and check it
from pursuing evil, so honor and praise quicken the
sense wonderfully, to attain the dignity and glory of
virtue." He quotes Cicero and Quintilian to the
same <span class="locked">effect.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></span></p>

<p>This was not to develop a false self-love in young
hearts; which would have been little to the purpose
with religious teachers. "Let them root out from
themselves, in every possible way, self-love and the
craving for vain glory," says the oldest code of school
rules in the Society, probably from the pen of
Father Peter Canisius <span class="locked">himself.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></span> What is appealed to,
is the spirit of emulation, and that by a world of
industries; which, disguising the aridity of the work
to be gone through, spurs young students on to
excellence in whatever they undertake, and rewards
the development of natural energies with the natural
luxury of confessedly doing well. In the dry course
of virtue and learning, satisfaction of this kind is not
excited in the young, without a sign, a token, a badge,
a prize. Then they feel happy in having done well,
however little they enjoyed the labor before. Honorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
distinctions well managed, sometimes a share in
the unimportant direction of the class, brilliancy of
success in single combat on the field of knowledge, of
memory, or of intellectual self-reliance, the ordered
discrimination of habitual merit, all these means and
many others keep the little army in a condition of
mental activity, and sometimes of suspense; "and if
not all are victorious, all at least have traversed the
strengthening probation of <span class="locked">struggle."<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></span></p>

<p>In all the courses of Belles-lettres, Rhetoric, Philosophy,
and Theology, the institutions called "Academies"
gather into select bodies the most talented and
exemplary of the students. The young <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">littérateurs</i>, or
philosophers, having their own officials, special reunions,
and archives, hold their public sessions in presence
of the other students, the Masters, and illustrious
personages invited for the occasion. In their poems,
speeches, dialogues, they discuss, declaim, and rise to
great thoughts, and to the conception of great deeds.</p>

<p>Civil discords are not the subject of their debates,
but the glories of their native country, its success in
arms, all that is congenial to the young mind and fosters
the sentiment of love of country. Among the
students of Rhetoric, forensic debates and judicial
trials are organized; "and when the advocates of both
sides have pleaded their cause in one or two sessions
of the court, then," says a document I am quoting
from, dated 1580, "the judge, who has been elected
for the purpose, will pronounce his judgment in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
oration of his own; this will be the brilliant performance;
and, to hear it, friends will be invited, and the
Doctors of the University and all the students will be
in <span class="locked">attendance."<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></span> In the programme for the distribution
of rewards, there is described an interesting element,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">puer lepidus</i>, "a bright young lad," and what he is to
do and how he is to bring out the name of the victor,
"whereupon the music will strike up a sweet <span class="locked">symphony."<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span>
At another time, a set of published theses
are defended against all comers by some philosopher
or theologian. And, while games and manly exercises
outside develop physical strength, gentility of demeanor
and elegance of deportment have the stage at their
service inside, for the exhibition of refined manners.</p>

<p>In all this, princes and nobles, future men of letters
and of action, are mingling in daily life, in contest and
emulation, with sons of the simplest burghers. <span class="locked">Descartes<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span>
notes these points sagaciously, when he recommends
to a friend the College of La Flèche: "Young
people are there," he says, "from all parts of France;
there is a mingling of characters; their mutual intercourse
effects almost the same good results as if they
were actually travelling; and, in fine, the equality
which the Jesuits establish among all, by treating just
in the same way those who are most illustrious and
those who are not so, is an extremely good <span class="locked">invention."<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
As the new sciences came into vogue, they received
at once the freedom of this city of intellect; and here
they received it first. It has been said, indeed, that
the Society of Jesus, "obstinately bound to its formalism,
refused to admit anything modern, real, and
actual, and that the national languages and literatures,
as well as the new developing sciences, fared ill at its
hands." This statement, as far as it concerns France,
is examined by Father Charles Daniel, who to other
valuable works of his own has added the neat little
essay called, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Les Jésuites Instituteurs de la Jeunesse
Française, au XVII<sup>e</sup> et au XVIII<sup>e</sup> siècle</i>.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> As to Germany,
we shall see indications enough on all these
subjects in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Monumenta Germaniæ Pædagogica</i>.
For all countries there is a sufficiency of information,
in the mere text of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>, in Jouvancy's
classic commentary thereupon, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Ratione Discendi et
Docendi</i>, and other authentic documents, besides the
actual practice visible in the colleges. But the whole
question about the vernacular tongues, as if they were
kept out of the colleges by Latin and Greek, is so far
an anachronism for the dates and epochs, regarding
which some moderns have agitated the question, that
I shall tell a little anecdote, which will not be so much
of a digression, but that it will place us back just
where we are at present.</p>

<p>In 1605, Lord Bacon published his two books on
the Advancement of Learning. The work is considered
the first part of his "Novum Organum." He undertakes
to "make a small Globe," as he says, "of
the Intellectual World, as truly and faithfully as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
can <span class="locked">discover.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> His subject is identical, as far as it
goes, with the much more extensive and exhaustive
work of Father Anthony Possevino, a famous Jesuit,
who had published, twelve years before, the results
of twenty years' travel and observation, while fulfilling,
in many countries, the important duties of
Apostolic Legate, Preacher, Professor. I have two
editions of his great tomes before me. The first is
that of Rome, 1593; the other that of Venice, 1603;
this latter is called "the most recent <span class="locked">edition."<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> The
only indication which I discern of Bacon's not having
profited by Possevino is this, that he says: "No man
hath propounded to himself the general state of learning
to be described and represented from age to <span class="locked">age."<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span>
Now, as this is saying too much, for it just indicates
what Possevino's labors had been showing to the
world during twelve years, I must conclude that there
is no assurance whatever, but that Bacon profited by
Possevino: he seems merely to have gone over the
same ground in English, and done justice to the subject,
in his own peculiar way. Accordingly, he did it what
justice he could, in English. Three years later he
writes to Dr. Playfer, Margaret Professor of Divinity
in the University of Cambridge, requesting that the
Doctor would be pleased to translate the work into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Latin; and his lordship promises eternal gratitude.
What reasons does the noble author urge for this request?
Two reasons, of which the first is very noteworthy
for our purpose:&mdash;"the privateness of the
language, wherein it is written, excluding so many
readers!" And the second is almost as worthy of
note:&mdash;"the obscurity of the argument, in many
parts of it, excluding many others!"<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> Here we have
our domestic classic author, in the year 1608, endeavoring
to get out of his narrow cell, the "privateness
of the English language," into the broad world of the
literary public, where the Jesuit with his tomes was
enjoying to the full his literary franchise. This does
not look as if the colleges, at that time, kept the languages
down, but rather that they had in their gift the
full freedom of the literary world, and sent students
forth to walk abroad at their ease there, where Bacon
humbly sued for admission!</p>

<p>I was going to quote from Possevino, describing in
a graphic way the daily intellectual life of the great
Roman College, with its two thousand and more students,
besides the great body of Professors. But my
limits forbid me to do more than refer to <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span></p>

<p>There are two views which may be taken of a coin,
and its stamp. One is taken direct, looking at it in
itself; the other is indirect, observing the impression
it leaves in the mould. It leaves a defined vacancy
there. What kind of vacancy was left in the intellectual
culture of Europe, when this intellectual system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
was suddenly swept away? Before the Suppression
of the Society, some of the institutions, which had
thriven at all, had been inspired by a healthful rivalry.
They found, when the Society was gone, that part of
their life decayed. And, while they themselves began
to languish, the place of the Jesuits they could
not fill. Of some others, who lived a life barely discernible,
we are given to understand, that their vitality
consisted in the effort to keep the Jesuits out. I
will take an instance from Bayonne.</p>

<p>A work has just been published on the municipal
college of Bayonne, by the Censor of Studies, in the
Lyceum of <span class="locked">Agen.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> In seventy pages, which concern
transactions with the <span class="locked">Jesuits,<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span> the author, in no friendly
tone, narrates the entire history from the documents
of the Jansenist party. I will imitate this example
of his so far as to narrate the following entirely in
his own words.</p>

<p>Beginning his last chapter, entitled "Reform and
Conclusion," he says in a tone somewhat subdued, but
not more so than his <span class="locked">subject:<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> "This then was the
College of Bayonne, which, for a few years more, prolonged
an existence ever more and more precarious;
and it was finally closed in 1792, in spite of several
generous efforts at restoring it.</p>

<p>"But already," he continues, "for thirty years, a
great literary event had been accomplished in secondary
education. A decree of the Parliament of Paris, dated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
the 16th of August, 1762, had pronounced the expulsion
of the 'ci-devant soi-disants Jésuites'; which
decree was this time definitively executed. Now the
Jesuits, in their five Provinces of France, possessed
then nearly a hundred colleges. Judge of the immense
void which was suddenly created in the secondary
instruction of the Province, ill prepared for so abrupt
a departure! There was a general confusion, and a
concert, as it were, of complaints and recriminations.
Where get the new masters?... The disciplinary
and financial administration of the colleges, left
vacant by the Jesuits, was confided to the bureaus,
that is to say, assemblies composed of the Archbishop
or Bishop, the Lieutenant General, the King's Proctor,
and the senior Alderman.... Every one soon felt
the inconveniences of this system. The municipal
officers of the cities, the bureaus themselves hastened
to petition the King, that their colleges might be confided
to religious communities. Thus it was that the
greater part of the old Jesuit colleges fell into the
hands of the Benedictines and Bernardines, of the
Carmelites and Minims, of Jacobins and Cordeliers,
of Capuchins and Recollects, of Doctrinaires and Barnabites,
and above all, of the Oratorians. But all
these Religious, except the Oratorians, fell far short
of the Jesuits. The greater part had not even any
idea of teaching, etc." Then the author devotes a
heavy page to the novel systems which were introduced.
He closes the paragraph sadly: "All this
agitation," he says, "was unfortunately sterile; and,
as I have just said, secondary instruction, on the eve
of the French Revolution, had not taken a step forward
during fifty years."</p>

<span class="subhead">THE MORAL SCOPE PROPOSED.</span></h2>

<p>Sweet is the holiness of youth, says Chaucer. Nor
less grateful to the eye are those gentle manners of
youth, which another bard portrays as impersonated
in his "celestial lights," who <span class="locked">say:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">We all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are ready at thy pleasure, well disposed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do thee gentle <span class="locked">service.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Christian morals and Christian manners make the perfect
gentleman.</p>

<p>Plato had put it down that "he who hath a good
soul is good"; and he insisted that no youth, who has
had a personal acquaintance with evil, can have a
good soul. He did not mean that a youth must be ignorant
of what temptation is. There is no hot-house
raising in this world which will keep off that blast.
Every child, while keeping on the royal road of innocence,
has enough in himself, and in the choicest
of surroundings, to know the realities of life and its
warfare. But Plato refers to a personal experience of
the by-ways, which are not virtue, and which it is not
necessary to travel by, in order to know enough about
them. The educational means, the industry, the vigilance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
which have for a result the preservation of youth
in the freshness of innocence, signify a medium of respiration
which is kept pure, and a moral nutriment
which is good and is kept constantly supplied, until
tender virtue has risen steadily into a well-knit rectitude,
and is able thenceforth to brave manfully the
incidental storms of life.</p>

<p>For this moral strengthening of character, no less
than for the invigorating of mental energies, the system
of Ignatius Loyola prescribes an education which
is public,&mdash;public, as being that of many students together,
public as opposed to private tutorism, public,
in fine, as requiring a sufficiency of the open, fearless
exercise both of practical morality and of religion.
Since the time of Ignatius, Dupanloup has observed
on this <span class="locked">subject:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"I have heard a man of great sense utter this remarkable
word. 'If a usurping and able government
wanted to get rid of great races in the country, and
root them out, it need only come down to this, that it
require of them, out of respect for themselves, to bring
up their children at home, alone, far from their equals,
shut up in the narrow horizon of a private education
and a private <span class="locked">tutor.'"<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span></p>

<p>The youthful material, on which the Jesuit system
had to work, may be described from two points of view.
There were home conditions; and there were conditions
too of the educational system, which was commonly
prevalent in those centuries.</p>

<p>As to the circumstances of polite society at the boys'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
homes, Charles Lenormant, speaking of those times,
tells us that "it was the privilege of a gentleman to
have from his infancy the responsibility of his own
actions. The fathers of families were the first to
launch their sons into the midst of the perils of the
world, even before the age of discernment had <span class="locked">begun."<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span>
Even when boys' homes effect no positive harm, still,
only too often, they answer this description, that they
undo the best of what the school training is endeavoring
to effect, by the discipline of subordination and
the practice of obedience.</p>

<p>It was this state of things which made the German
Jesuits, in spite of themselves, petition for the requisite
authorization to open boarding colleges in the
north, as had already been done in Portugal and elsewhere.
Reluctantly the authorization was given by
the general <span class="locked">assembly.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> These <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictus</i>, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pensionnats</i>,
were known to make great inroads on the time of the
Fathers, on their study, their religious retirement,
and especially on that immunity of theirs from financial
transactions, which they enjoyed as Religious.
The Constitution of Ignatius offers no more than a
bare foothold for the introduction of these <span class="locked">colleges.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span>
Yet they have proved to be the most prolific nurseries
of the eminent men, whom the Society has sent forth
into all the walks of life.</p>

<p>Not at home alone were effeminacy and dissoluteness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
to be feared. There were conditions of life in
the university system of the sixteenth century, which
seemed considerably worse than those already described
in the first chapter of this book. Possevino,
who had spent ten years in the midst of the religious
turmoils of France, and ten more in Papal legations
to Germany, Poland, Hungary, Transylvania, Russia,
Muscovy, Sweden, and Gothia, and, after that, four
more years in visiting the universities throughout
Europe, notices that there were five ways, whereby a
general corruption of society had come about. First,
he mentions the dissemination of bad books. Secondly,
"the omission of lectures; or, when lectures were
held, such disturbances during them, with noise and
yells, that there scarce remained an appearance of
human, let alone of Christian, society. Thirdly, factions.
Fourthly, sensuality, to which cause must be
referred that atrocious kind of iniquity, whereby the
very walls of the schools were defiled with writing and
the vilest <span class="locked">pictures;<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> so that the tender age, which had
come innocent, must go away more polluted with
crime, than imbued with learning, becoming hateful
to God himself. Fifthly, an aversion for Divine worship,
inasmuch as disputations and graduating festivities
and lectures have constantly been transferred to
those days and those hours, when by Divine precept
public worship is <span class="locked">due."<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span></p>

<p>The means organized by Ignatius into a method of
moral education I will sketch in the words of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
contemporaries. Ribadeneira, his biographer, says:
"Those means are employed by our Masters, whereby
virtue is conceived in the hearts of the pupils, is preserved
and augmented. They are morning prayer,
for obtaining grace from God not to fall into sin;
night prayer and a diligent reflection on all the
thoughts, words, and actions of the day, to do away by
contrition of heart with all the faults committed; the
attentive and devout hearing of Mass every day;
frequent and humble confession of sins to a Priest;
and if they are old enough, and great devotion
recommends it, and their confessor approves of it,
the reverent and pious reception of the Body of
our Lord Jesus Christ; teaching and explaining the
rudiments of the Christian faith, whereby the boys
are animated to live well and happily. Besides, great
pains are taken to know and root out the vices of boyhood,
especially such as are somehow inborn and
native to that <span class="locked">age."<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span></p>

<p>Here, by the way, the reader may advert to the
fact that the confessional, of which mention is made,
never comes in as part of the external means of moral
development; nor is a superior ever the confessor
of those under his charge, except when desired to
be so by the free choice of the subordinate himself.
A general law of the Catholic Church ordains it
thus.</p>

<p>Loyola's biographer goes on to the various means,
whereby, in such a multitude of young persons, the bad
element, which unfortunately will never die, is either
suppressed and kept at its lowest stage of a struggling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
vitality, or else, if it happens to shoot up, is weeded
out. The garden will be none the poorer for that.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nil dabit inde minus!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There are, moreover, the division of students into
categories and ranks, with their own officers from
among the boys themselves; the degrees of honor and
preëminence assigned to good conduct and virtue;
especially the pious societies or Sodalities, into which
none are admitted save the most studious and virtuous
among the youths; and that with a discrimination
in favor of superior merit, even among such as
answer the general description. The Sodalities of the
Society of Jesus, as the subject of a study upon the
management of youth, and indeed upon the cultivation
of all ranks in Christian society, from Peer and Field
Marshal and Viceroy, down to the little boy beginning
his career at school, would deserve a special discourse
for themselves.</p>

<p>I will continue now from Possevino, describing the
Roman College, which was an object of daily observation
to the capital of the Christian <span class="locked">world.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span> "Here,"
he says, "you have two thousand youths, among
whom reigns a deep silence; there is no commotion.
In the classes there is no reading of profane author or
poet, who might inoculate the mind with defilement."
I may remark that Ignatius had, from the very first,
begun the method of expurgating authors, a task
which was then carried on with diligence by the literary
men of the Society. Our author resumes: "A
hundred daily occasions of sin and idleness are precluded;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
a continuous series is going on of lectures,
repetitions, disputations, conferences." Then he portrays,
as visible there in every-day life, many of the
features which Ribadeneira has mentioned.</p>

<p>While idleness was under a ban, vacation was not debarred.
Its principles, however, were defined on new
lines. There was a sufficiency of rest to be provided;
but then no new intermissions were to be granted. The
"sufficiency" would appear spare luxury to our looser
<span class="locked">times.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span> "One week of doing nothing," say the Fathers
of Upper Germany to the General Aquaviva, "is
more hurtful to students, than four weeks in which
some literary exercise is kept up"; and "parents
take very much amiss this state of idleness, if the boys
remain on our <span class="locked">hands."<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span></p>

<p>In all this, there was no question of making religious
men of the students. It was a question only of
Religious making men of them. Father George Bader,
Provincial of Upper Germany in 1585, left it in his
instructions for the management of the convictus, at
Dilingen, that "the Prefects were not to despair or
despond, if they did not see at once, or in all, the improvement
desired; nor were they to require the perfection
of Religious from them, nor introduce among
them such practices of life, as elsewhere the students
could not keep up in their calling; but the directors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
should be content with having a manner of life followed,
which was ordinary, virtuous, and <span class="locked">pious."<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span></p>

<p>According to this idea, the religious teacher being a
man, a citizen, and an ecclesiastic, his educational industry
has produced its effect, when it has made accomplished
men, worthy citizens, competent Ecclesiastics,
or Religious; "when in the school," says Ribadeneira,
"as in an arena, the students, foreshadowing the
future, practise already, in their own way, those same
virtues and duties, which in maturer years they will
exhibit, in the management of the <span class="locked">republic."<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span> The rich
material of the youthful mind and soul receives the
manifold influence which the teacher's mind and heart
possess; and receives it after the manner of the recipient,
according to his future vocation.</p>

<p>What the Jesuit professors, in fact, were like, those
who in after years showed themselves but little
friendly to the Order did not omit to testify. "During
the seven years," says Voltaire, "that I lived in
the house of the Jesuits, what did I see among them?
The most laborious, frugal, and regular life, all their
hours divided between the care they spent on us and
the exercises of their austere profession. I attest the
same as thousands of others brought up by them, like
myself; not one will be found to contradict me. Hence
I never cease wondering how any one can accuse
them of teaching corrupt morality.... Let any one
place side by side the 'Provincial Letters' and the
Sermons of Father Bourdaloue; he will learn in the
former the art of raillery, the art of presenting things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
indifferent in themselves, under aspects which make
them appear criminal, the art of insulting with eloquence;
he will learn from Father Bourdaloue, that of
being severe to oneself, and indulgent toward <span class="locked">others."<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span></p>

<p>History is uniform in bearing witness that the general
effects of their teaching corresponded to the example
of these Professors, in spite of the fact, as
Cretineau-Joly puts it, that even from the hands of
religious men the impious can still come forth, as, in
the school of the wise, dunces and dolts may still be
<span class="locked">found.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span> Man is still and always free. However, if it
follows thence, that not only a positive, but a negative
result may always be expected; such a double result
may be set off by two consoling reflections, which I
will mention, in order to complete the picture of this
education in practice.</p>

<p>The first is, that since, from the school of virtue
and religiousness, vice can still issue forth, and, as the
General Vitelleschi says, a good education, though
almost omnipotent, may, like the morning dew, evaporate
and be lost in the first heat of manhood's <span class="locked">passions,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span>
what would be the results of the system, if it had less
piety to enlighten, or less of an organized practice of
virtue to confirm, the minds and hearts of the young?</p>

<p>Another reflection is this: that human nature, however
erratic by defect of will, still remains beautiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
thanks to the original gift of God. Whence it comes,
that impiety is found beautifully inconsistent; and,
in its lucid intervals, it makes the due acknowledgment,
as he did, who once <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Society of Jesus has many a time been elegantly
blessed and cursed by the same eloquent lips and pens.</p>

<p>The secret of this magisterial ascendency, as Ignatius
of Loyola projected it, was to be found in
the Masters' intellectual attainments, which naturally
impressed youthful minds; and also in a paternal
affection which, of course, won youthful hearts. Does
anything more seem necessary for the full idea of
authority? The committee appointed by the canton
of Fribourg, for restoring the Fathers to their old college
in 1818, mention as one reason for having done
so, that "the will cannot be chained; it will not submit
to restraint. You can win it, but not subjugate
it." And they speak of that "most lively attachment"
ever abiding in the hearts of students towards
members of the Order, which they have known as the
cradle of their <span class="locked">youth.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span> The same Father Bader,
whom I have quoted before, defines where authority
lies, when he says: "Let not the Prefects consider
their authority to consist in this, that the students are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
on hand in obedience to their nod, their every word,
or their very look; but in this, that the boys love
them, approach with confidence, and make their difficulties
known." Speaking of penalties, he goes on:
"The pupils should be led to understand that such reprehensions
are necessary and are prompted by affection;
and let it be the most grievous rebuke or penalty for
them to know that they have offended their <span class="locked">Prefect."<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, in the education of the sixteenth century,
there came into play a gradual reaction against the
harshness and brusquer manners of earlier times.
Speaking of conversation with the students, the General
Vitelleschi, in 1639, gives characteristic directions:
"It will be very useful if from time to time
the Professors treat with their auditors, and converse
with them, not about vain rumors and other
affairs that are not to the purpose, but about those
which appertain most to their well-being and education;
going down to particulars that seem most to
meet their wants; and showing them, in a familiar
way, how they ought to conduct themselves in studies
and piety. Let the Professors be persuaded that a
single talk in private, animated with true zeal and
prudence on their part, will penetrate the heart more
and work more powerfully, than many lectures and
sermons given in <span class="locked">common."<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span></p>

<p>Here then I have touched on the secrets of success,
those principles which commanded esteem, and shed
about the Order an unmistakable halo of educational
prestige.</p>

<span class="subhead">IGNATIUS ADMINISTERING THE COLLEGIATE SYSTEM.
HIS DEATH.</span></h2>

<p>The first two colleges were established in the same
year, 1542,&mdash;one of them in the royal university at
Coimbra in Portugal, the other at Goa in Hindustan.
Though they were organized at an early date, only
two years after the foundation of the Order, when as
yet no system had been formally adopted, nevertheless
these two first colleges, a good many thousands of
miles apart, were found to have been established in
precisely the same way. Francis Xavier, having been
assigned to the apostolic ministry in the East, began
a university there, in which all the sciences and
branches were professed, just as in the European colleges.
This became the base of operations for Japan,
China, Persia, Ethiopia, and the other nations of the
East. Forty years later, there were as many as one
hundred and twenty Jesuits in the college.</p>

<p>In 1542, Ignatius had a select body of fifteen or sixteen
young men studying in Paris; others he had
placed in Padua or elsewhere. He availed himself of
the actual universities until such time as he should
have his own. War breaking out between the Emperor
Charles V and the French King Francis, all
Spaniards and Belgians were ordered out of France.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Such as were Italians remaining in Paris, the other
young Jesuits crossed the frontier to Louvain, under
the charge of Father Jerome Domenech. There the
Latin oratory of the youth, Francis Strada, whom Lefèvre,
on his way through Belgium, supplied with
matter for his <span class="locked">orations,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span> helped to build up the Order
rapidly with two kinds of men, talented youths, who
were captivated by the things they saw and heard,
and men already eminent, who were equally attracted
by the scope of the new Institute. In the
young Strada preaching and the eminent Lefèvre
going out of his way to subsidize him with matter, we
catch a family glimpse of that intensified force which
can be developed in a closely bound organization.</p>

<p>Conspicuously wanting in gifts of presence and of
learning, Francis Villanova, sent by Ignatius to the
university seat of Alcalà, won such an ascendency
there by his other qualities as a Priest, that a commodious
and flourishing college was soon founded.
Father Jerome Domenech endowed one in his native
city of Valentia, 1543. Lefèvre and Araoz, following
awhile by royal request in the suite of the Princess
Mary, daughter of the Portuguese King, and queen of
the Spanish King, founded a college at Valladolid.
In Gandia, his own duchy, Francis Borgia erected
and richly equipped a university, which was the first
placed in the hands of the Society.</p>

<p>Colleges at Barcelona, Bologna, Saragossa, arose
within the next two or three years; also at Messina,
Palermo, Venice, and Tivoli. It is evident that Ignatius
had a world of administration already on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
hands. As early as March 16, 1540, he had excused
himself from granting an application, because of
"much pains he was taking in sending some to the Indies,
others to Ireland and to parts of Italy." Now,
though his forces were increasing, yet he was husbanding
them; and even so, while refusing many applications,
he seemed to be everywhere. But this need not
be so much a matter of wonder, if we consider that it
is the right place, and the right move at the proper
time, that commands other places, movements, and
times.</p>

<p>At the death of Lefèvre, in 1546, the onward movement
of these select men, coming in contact, either
friendly or adverse, with every actual power in Europe,
was so impressive for its strategic completeness,
and so far-reaching in its results, that, as an historian
remarks, "These ten men, so ably chosen, had accomplished
to their entire satisfaction, in less than six
years, what the most absolute monarch would not have
ventured to exact of the most blind <span class="locked">devotedness."<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span></p>

<p>Hardly had Lefèvre departed this life, when his
place was taken by the last man whom he had dealt
with, Francis Borgia, Duke of Gandia, the friend and
cousin of the Emperor Charles V. Still wearing his
ducal robes, until his temporal affairs could be settled,
he came to Rome in 1550. He founds the Roman College,
which is the centre and type of all Jesuit colleges.</p>

<p>It was begun on February 18th, 1551, at the foot of
the Capitol, with fourteen members of the Order, and
Father John Peltier, a Frenchman, at their head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
Doubling this number in the following September, the
College moved to a larger building. The Professors
taught Rhetoric, and three languages, Hebrew, Greek,
and Latin. In 1553, the entire course of Philosophy
and Theology was added. The number of Jesuit
students among the auditory amounted, in this year,
to sixty, and, in the following year, to one hundred.
A few years later, Vittoria Toffia, niece of Paul IV,
and wife of Camillo Orsini, provided the institution
with a splendid property. Thenceforth, the number
of Jesuit students alone was as high as 220, brought
together from sixteen or more different nations, most
of them familiar with many languages, all speaking
by rule the tongue of the country in which they were
residing, and all competent to speak and teach in the
one universal and learned language of the time, the
Latin tongue.</p>

<p>Of students not belonging to the Order, nearly
twenty colleges are enumerated, at some periods, as
following the courses of this central Roman College.
They included the colleges of the English, the Greeks,
the Scotch, the Maronites, the Irish, and the Neophytes;
the Colleges named Capranica, Fuccioli,
Mattei, Pamfili, Salviati, Ghislieri; the German College
and the College Gymnasio; also the Roman
Seminary. Of the 2107 students counted, as following
the courses at a given time, 300 were in theology.
The most eminent professors filled the chairs, in successive
generations; theologians like Suarez and
Vasquez, commentators like Cornelius a Lapide and
Maldonado, founders or leaders in the schools of national
history like Mariana and Pallavicini; Clavius,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
reformer of the Gregorian calendar; Kircher, universal
in all exact sciences; and so of the rest; while
the cycle of colleges over the world remained provided
with their requisite forces, and maintained their
own <span class="locked">prestige.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span></p>

<p>The emblem of this institution was Theology, enthroned,
as it were, in a temple of imposing proportions.
At her right and left two Maids of Honor stand;
they are the Natural Sciences. One of them, representing
Mathematics, is placing the celestial sphere
under the feet of the august goddess seated; the other,
representing Physics, is subjecting, in like manner,
the orb of the earth. The legend attached reads:
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Leges impone subactis</i>.</p>

<p>In forty or fifty years such an investment of talent,
character, and virtue, had been made, by management
within the Order, and by that power to which Ignatius
always appealed, Divine Providence, that Rome
had seen pass through this house the most distinguished
men of the age, in every line of intellectual
life, of moral eminence, and of all that could elevate
the thoughts of noble and generous minds. For the
young, in particular, three characters came, figures
that were to fill the niches and terminate the aisles
of contemplation, as the ideal choice of the bloom of
youth&mdash;Stanislaus Kostka, a young Polish noble of
seventeen, Aloysius Gonzaga, an Italian prince of
twenty-three, and John Berchmans, a Flemish burgher
of twenty-two. Being what they were, and leaving
this life at such an age, they have appropriated in the
Catholic Church the honors of the young.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
With regard to Germany, it is with a classic touch,
as of Cæsar's style, that an historian introduces the subject
thus: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Germania, quo gravius laboravit, hoc studiosius
adjuta est; Ignatio nulla regio commendatior</i>.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> Nor
will the association be considered far-fetched, if, substituting
for Cæsar's pen and Cæsar's sword, Loyola's
legislation for letters and his strategic tactics, one
catches a suggestive idea, on the present topic, from
that statue of the same Roman General, which represents
him as holding in one hand a sword, and in the
other a pen, with the words inscribed underneath, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ex
utroque Cæsar</i>.</p>

<p>Of the services of those nine men, with whom he
founded the Order, he spent a large part upon Germany.
Lefèvre was there, Le Jay, Bobadilla, Salmeron,
Laynez; not to mention the great Canisius (de
Hondt), a young man already in the field, who was to
stay there for half a century. It is of these men and
their work that Ranke writes: "Of what country
were these, the first of their Order amongst us?
They were natives of Spain, Italy, the Netherlands.
For a long time, even the name of their Society was
unknown, and they were styled the Spanish Priests.
They filled the chairs of the universities, and there
met with disciples willing to embrace their faith.
Germany has no part in them; their doctrine, their
constitution, had been completed and reduced to form,
before they appeared in our midst. We may then
regard the progress of their Institute here, as a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
participation of Latin Europe in German Europe.
They have defeated us upon our own soil, and wrested
from us a share of our <span class="locked">fatherland."<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span></p>

<p>In concert with the Duke of Bavaria and the Emperor
Ferdinand, Ingolstadt and Vienna became the
two first centres of operations. Ingolstadt was indeed
destined to become soon one of the most representative
universities of the Company, and the German
centre of what has been called the <span class="locked">"Counter-Reformation."<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span>
But Ignatius would not accept it,
without the clearest enunciation of some fundamental
principles in the educational work of his Institute.
I will mention them.</p>

<p>First, the condition of all higher studies, and of lower
studies as well, was such, that, as Ignatius said, it was
useless to begin with the top, which without a good
foundation will never stand. The disappointment of
individual hopes and of general expectation would be
the only result, with demoralization for the future.
Let Literature, he said, and Philosophy be gone
through satisfactorily; then Theology may be approached.
Literature must come first of all. Hence
Polanco, the secretary of Ignatius, writes to the Duke
of Bavaria, in 1551, that the "Jesuits must begin by
undertaking preparatory teaching, with Professors
capable of inspiring their young students, little by
little, with a taste for <span class="locked">Theology."<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Secondly, we may recall to mind what was mentioned
<span class="locked">before,<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span> that Ignatius provides for Law and Medicine
in his universities, but the professors of these departments
are to be taken from without the Order. Now,
quite as a counterpart to this, we find him declaring
to the Duke of Bavaria, that it is at variance with his
plan to lend any Professors or Lecturers of the Order
for work outside of Jesuit institutions. Therefore
a college must be founded for them, or the Duke
cannot have them.</p>

<p>The reason for this reserve is not hard to discern.
In an organization like his, there are no men at large
to lend. And, were the most eminent men assigned
for work outside of the Jesuit colleges and universities,
the younger generation of the Order would practically
be debarred from the influence of their type of
eminence. And again, if there were eminent men
laboring in a country, without the stable abode of a
Jesuit college in the same place, there would be no
propagating the distinctive work of the Order itself,
by means of the men of that country. Yet, as he projected
a native clergy for Germany, so he intended
native Jesuits for the Germans. Besides, it does not
seem possible to accept of a chair outside, except on
the basis of some pecuniary consideration for the individual
Professor. Now this is a situation which he
does not accept. A Professed Father is not to sacrifice
his religious life and independence, bound to a
work outside of the Order's own houses, and that for a
valuable consideration. Ignatius accepts of no obligations
to fill chairs, save as accepting universities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
which contain those <span class="locked">chairs.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></span> And, as to pecuniary
considerations, his principle is, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Gratis accepistis, gratis
date</i>; "Give freely what you have freely received."
To this cardinal principle the statutes of
so many universities, if not of all, in which a Jesuit
College conducted any of the faculties, distinctly
refer, as the ground for exempting Religious of the
Society from all pecuniary charges, incidental to
university <span class="locked">affairs.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span> No ingenious compromise was
admitted which tended to relax this principle, regarding
a pecuniary <span class="locked">consideration.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></span> On the contrary, the
most legitimate and ample revenues offered were not
accepted as a recommendation for a university, if
there were any conditions whatever not in keeping
with the <span class="locked">Institute.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a></span></p>

<p>The German College in Rome was founded by Ignatius,
to form German ecclesiastics for the Germans.
At that time benefices and parochial cures, in the
German Emperor's dominions, were generally vacant
for want of Priests. It soon came to pass that Priests
were found to be in waiting, for want of benefices. It
was not merely for the ordinary cure of souls that
this college received so much attention from Loyola.
True to himself, ever contemplating something eminent,&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">rarum
et eximium facinus</i>, as he said once to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
the Scholastics of Coimbra, "that rare and excellent
achievement; which is worth more than six hundred
common ones,"&mdash;he was founding a seminary for
preachers, professors, prelates. If the students sent
from Germany, to be admitted and supported on this
foundation, are not noblemen, "at all events," writes
Ignatius in 1552, "let nobility of soul not be wanting
to <span class="locked">them."<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></span> This is the institution which caused so
much vexation to non-Catholic Germany. It renovated
the priesthood.</p>

<p>Thus, then, in a short official career of sixteen years,
Ignatius had the gratification of seeing a new and
vast educational policy crowned with success. In
spite of the active opposition which powerful interests
in Rome led against him&mdash;and a vigorous siege from
the side of the schoolmasters was not to be despised,
nor should it fail to be recorded,&mdash;in spite of the desperate
hostility of the Sorbonne, which was but beginning
its war upon the Society in France, with
storms at Toledo and Saragossa flanking his movements
in Spain; in spite of the open war with heresy in
Protestant Germany, where acrimony, distilled to its
last degree of concentration, was to embitter history,
till the days of Ranke and Janssen should come, and
begin to vindicate the truth of history; thanks to the
labors of Ignatius, the monopoly of education was being
broken down; the old universities were no longer
either the sole depositories of superior instruction,
or the arbiters of the intellectual life of Europe; and
all the best learning, which the most accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
men could impart, was now being given gratuitously,
and in as many centres of educational activity as the
Society was allowed to create. And, whereas it is
put down to the credit of Germany, that sixteen of
the old universities had arisen on its soil, now, in the
German Assistency of the Society, there arose more
than sixteen Jesuit universities, besides two hundred
colleges. And, in virtue of Papal charters, it was
already an accomplished fact, that all the powers of
universities, with regard to the degrees of Bachelor,
Master, Licentiate, and Doctor, were vested in the
head of the Order, who could delegate the same to
subordinate <span class="locked">Superiors.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></span></p>

<p>No wonder all the faculties of Christendom considered
the Order an intruder and an aggressor. It
might be considered so to-day. Free and universal
education was at the doors of all. We, men of the
nineteenth century, may flatter ourselves that it was
the spirit of our age which breathed upon the Order
of Jesus, three centuries before the time. Perhaps
so. But we shall have to wait a few centuries more,
even beyond the nineteenth century, before we come to
such education given universally and given gratuitously.
For it is one of the most palpable characteristics
of all educational and other philanthropy which
we know of, that it is an extremely expensive thing.</p>

<p>Let us now close our sketch of the great educator,
Saint Ignatius of Loyola. All the particulars of his
death have been preserved for us by those who were
with him at the last. They were not his first companions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
Of these, the few who survived at the present
date, sixteen years after the foundation of the Society,
were scattered in various climes. The members with
him were John Polanco, his polished secretary, André
Frusis, a Frenchman, one of the most gifted of linguists
and of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">littérateurs</i>, Christopher Madrizi, a university
Doctor of Alcalà, and Jerome Nadal, whom in
Paris, long before, Ignatius had endeavored to enlist
in the service of his Institute; but Nadal had rejected
all overtures, pointing to the Bible under his arm, and
saying he wanted no other institute save that. He
was a man of the first quality in judgment and the
governing cast of mind. Later on, when the exploits
of Saint Francis Xavier in India and Japan had become
the talk and admiration of Europe, Nadal entered
the Order, so cautiously that one might say he
did it reluctantly; yet he did it. His subsequent career
showed that he had made a mistake, when he
missed a place in the very first ranks.</p>

<p>Others were close by. Laynez lay in a sick-room;
as was thought, on his death-bed; Mendoza too, and
Martin Olave. The latter, some thirty years before,
was a boy whom Ignatius met, when as a poor pilgrim
he reached Alcalà from Barcelona, to take up his university
studies. The boy gave him an alms, the first
received by Ignatius in that city. Time had passed
since then. The boy had become a Master of Arts,
and, in 1543, a Doctor of the Paris University, remarkable
in many ways for virtue and learning. Now, a
man of mature age and great authority, he had embraced
the Institute of Ignatius. He alone of the invalids
died immediately after his master in religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
The latter, on July the 30th, told them he was
about to die. But, diseases having preyed upon him
for years, the physicians did not confirm what he said;
and Father Ignatius made no more statements on the
subject. He spent the evening in his usual manner,
transacted some business with perfect serenity of
mind, and then was left alone till the morrow.</p>

<p>The morrow is just dawning, when they find him
breathing his last. He declines to accept any potion.
Joining his hands together, with his eyes fixed
heavenward, and pronouncing the name of "Jesus,"
the founder of the Society of Jesus passes away from
this life, in the Professed House at Rome.</p>

<p>It was the thirty-first day of July, 1556. He was
sixty-five years of age. Thirty-five years had passed,
since the Knight of the King of Navarre had, with
such solemnity, changed his garb, hung up his sword
and poniard in the sanctuary of Montserrat, and vowed
himself to be a Knight in the Kingdom of Christ.</p>

<p>All the time since then he had spent in extreme
poverty, in the practice of austerity, in the laborious
travels of a pilgrim, in the more laborious pursuit of
letters, under the stress of persecution, prisons, and
chains, and under the relentless fatigue of a universal
foresight, vigilance, and administration. He had
proved himself a leader and commander of men, as
nature had made him to be, and as history shows that
he was.</p>

<p>In an especial manner, he is famous for his prudence.
Approaching every enterprise with the most varied
and exhaustive deliberation, spending forty days of
meditation on determining a single point of the Constitution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
throwing upon his premises every kind of
light from consultation and advice, and having habitually
in his room, for reference, only two books, the
New Testament, and the Imitation of Christ, he
thought out every plan to the last degree of definiteness
and consistency. Having once reached such a
definite conclusion, he was not easy to move thenceforth
out of the direction taken. Quite otherwise.
With the utmost vigilance, he applied himself and he
applied all the means, whether they were persons available
or measures necessary, to the execution of his purpose.
Even when, as often seemed to be the case, he
was starting from principles other than those of ordinary
human foresight, apparently from a pure trust
in Divine Providence, he did not exempt himself from
applying, with the same circumspection and diligence
as ever, the means adequate to execute what he had
begun. Waiting fourteen hours, and fasting withal,
in the ante-chamber of a prince, lest the propitious
occasion should slip, writing out the same letter twice,
thrice, and oftener, lest the right thing should not be
said in the right way, and sending out thirty letters
in one night, he exhibited, in the administration of
great things and small, what had marked all his previous
deliberation, the highest degree of consummate
prudence and of practical perfection.</p>

<p>If, in all this, there are many eminent qualities to
admire, there is a resultant fact more marvellous still.
He did his work so that it went on without him.
And hence, if, whenever he happened to be anywhere
on the field of action, account had to be taken of such
a man, it will not perhaps appear singular that his Order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
too, even when ostracized and expatriated, is taken into
account, if it is anywhere visible on the social horizon.
While I am writing this, three hundred and fifty years
after his time, the Bundesrath, on closing the Kulturkampf,
and admitting all the exiled Orders of the
Catholic Church back into the Empire of Germany,
makes an exception of the Jesuits. It bans the Order
of Jesus, and gives no reason, beyond the palpable
fact that the Order is what it is. Evidently, Ignatius

<span class="subhead">SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATIONS.</span></h2>

<p>According to a contemporary chronicle for the year
1556, the first announcement of the death of Ignatius
caused such a profound sentiment of grief in all members
of the Order, that a degree of stupor seemed for
the moment to possess them. But this was only temporary.
It was followed by a marked alacrity of
spirit appearing everywhere. The Society was beginning
its <span class="locked">course.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></span></p>

<p>In the first general assembly, Father James Laynez
was elected to succeed the founder, in the office of
General Superior. The matters which concerned the
assembly in its legislation, and the new General in his
administration, were the proper temporal foundation
of colleges, the admission of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictus</i> or boarding-colleges,
and other questions, which may be noted in
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Monumenta Germaniæ Pædagogica</i>.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> Laynez governed
the Order during nine years, till 1565.</p>

<p>Father Francis Borgia, who had resigned his dukedom,
and by this example led Charles V to seek repose
in the monastery of St. Yuste, was elected third General.
His virtues and his presence, wherever he appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
exercised such a magic influence that, when
he had merely passed through Spain, colleges had
sprung up as from the soil. Three Provinces had
been formed in that country alone, within thirteen
years from the foundation of the Society. But this
multiplication of colleges, often not sufficiently endowed
for their future development, was already seen
to be one of the threatened weaknesses of the Company.
The special legislation passed at the time of his election
regarded the proper establishment, in every Province,
of philological, philosophical, and theological
seminaries, for the formation of <span class="locked">Professors.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></span> Instead
of the proportionate number of Jesuit students being
supported on each collegiate foundation, this legislation,
and much more that followed later, ordained a
system of concentration in seminaries of humane letters,
philosophy, science, and divinity, which were conducted
respectively by corps of eminent Professors selected
for the purpose, and were maintained either on some
munificent foundation specially made for this object,
or by a due proportion of the other collegiate foundations.
At this date it was that colleges for the formation
of diocesan clergy, or "Bishops' Seminaries,"
as they are commonly called, were coming into existence,
in accordance with the decrees of the Council
of Trent. The manner of admitting them, as annexed
to colleges of the Society, and thereby availing themselves
of the Jesuit courses, was regulated by this
assembly. In no case were they to be provided with
a corps of Professors distinct from the faculty of the
college.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
In 1573 Father Everard Mercurian, a Belgian, was
elected to succeed Saint Francis Borgia. He was
sixty-eight years old at the time of his election, and
lived eight years after. He drew out of the Constitution
various summaries of rules for the guidance of
the chief officers in the Society. Those which concern
studies are given in a few pages of the <span class="locked">Monumenta.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></span></p>

<p>At his death, a young man thirty-seven years old,
who had entered the Order only about twelve years
before, was elected to succeed him. This was Claudius
Aquaviva, son of Prince John Aquaviva, Duke of
Atri. He was a man who, for his superior executive
abilities and his services rendered to the Order in
times most critical, has been regarded as a second
founder. As to what his administration saw effected
in the matter of education, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i> bears
witness. He governed the Society during thirty-four
years.</p>

<p>Mutius Vitelleschi, one of the mildest and gentlest
of men, but not on that account ineffective in his government,
succeeded Aquaviva, filling a term of thirty-one
years, from 1615 to 1646. Various pedagogic interests
occupied the attention of the general assembly,
by which he was elected; in particular, the promotion
of Humane Letters, the means of supplying Professors,
and the searching character of the examinations
ordained, at every step in their studies, for the members
of the Society.</p>

<p>The farther the Society advanced in history, the
less there was of new legislation. The tension grew
on the side of administration; and the urgency shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
by general assemblies evinces this. The philological
seminary was developed for the junior scholastics;
and a classic form drawn up for it by Jouvancy. As
distinguished talents for preaching and governing
were treated with the special favor of being allowed
to compensate for some deficiencies, in the qualifications
requisite for the degree of Profession in the
Order, so special legislation provided for similar eminence
in literature, in Oriental languages, in Greek
and Hebrew.</p>

<p>Mathematics had, from the first, been a department
of activity native to the energies of the Company.
The schools of Geography and History developed in
the seventeenth and at the beginning of the eighteenth
centuries. The school of modern Physics then
asserting itself, and running so close upon the field of
Metaphysics, was subjected to regulations in the assemblies
of 1730 and 1751.</p>

<p>After the restoration of the Order, social and educational
circumstances being so immensely altered, the
whole ground had to be surveyed again, with a view
to adaptation; the curriculum had to be expanded, and,
where necessary, prolonged to meet the growing demands
of the exact sciences; and an indefinite number
of specialties to be provided for, by the selection and
fostering of special talents. These special lines are,
in the terms of the latest general assembly, "Ancient
Languages, Philology, Ethnology, Archæology, History,
Higher Mathematics, and all the Natural Sciences."
We are thus brought down, in the history of
general legislation, to the very recent date, 1883, less
than ten years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Meanwhile the Generals, on whom rested the burden
of supervising all this, discharged the functions of administration.
Father Vincent Caraffa promoted and
urged on the pursuit of Belles Lettres, and defined positions
in Mathematics. Father Francis Piccolomini, in
a general ordinance for all the higher studies, defined
the stand to be taken by Professors, as representing
the Society itself in their chairs; so, too, Father Goswin
Nickel, with reference to certain new issues.
Both he and his successor, Paul Oliva, had to face
the new contingencies which arose from the charges
of the Jansenists against what they called the loose
moral teachings of the Jesuits. Father Oliva stimulated
the pursuit of excellence in Humane Letters, in
the Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldaic languages.
Positions of Descartes, Leibnitz, as well as of certain
others in Philosophy and Theology, were animadverted
upon by the Generals Tamburini and Retz.
Father Ignatius Visconti urged again the pursuit of
perfection in literary matters, and in the manner of
conducting the schools of literature. And the General
Aloysius Centurione, shortly before the Suppression,
laid down the clearest principles with respect to
the study of Moral Theology, and the examinations
therein. Since the restoration of the Order, Fathers
Roothaan, Beckx, and the actual General, Anthony M.
Anderledy, have devoted their own attention and
directed that of the Society to the ways of accepting,
with undiminished energy, the altered and unfavorable
situation, in which the present century has
placed the Order, and hampers the revived Institute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
For this immense organization had been almost entirely
destroyed by the stroke of a pen&mdash;the signature
of Clement XIV given in pencil. They dispute
whether he gave it at all; or, at least, whether he
meant it. Howsoever that be, the Order, which had
been erected on the principle of obedience, received
the word and disappeared. The rock on which it
had set its foot became the altar of a sacrifice; and
that a sacrifice offered without a struggle or a remonstrance,
to betray any change in the spirit, with which
Ignatius, two hundred and thirty-three years before,
had vowed obedience to the Vicar of Christ. An epigram
had been written, on the occasion of the first
centenary, under a picture of Archimedes and his
lever; Archimedes is getting a foothold for his lever
to move the world; and beneath is the <span class="locked">epigram:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fac pedem figat, et terram movebit.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Its footing was now taken away, and it vanished from
the world.</p>

<p>While the Catholic Bourbon courts were thus successful
in accomplishing a manœuvre, which at fitful
intervals they had essayed heretofore, the schismatical
Empress, Catherine II of Russia, denounced it and
endeavored to counteract it. She wrote to the Pope
in 1783, "that she was resolved to maintain these
Priests against any power, whatsoever it was"; and
she was good to her word; the Society remained unsuppressed
in White Russia. The Protestant King
of Prussia, Frederick the Great, without exhibiting all
the temper of the irascible lady, manipulated things
as best he could to preserve the Society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
To sum up the Order's experiences, it may well be
said that in public life there is no resurrection; and
the State which dies is dead forever. From infancy
on through maturity it goes its way decrepit to the
grave. Yet Balmez observes, "the Society of Jesus
did not follow the common course of others, either in
its foundation, its development, or its fall; that Order,
of which it is truly and correctly said, that it had
neither infancy nor old <span class="locked">age."<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></span> It rose again; and
the flag of the Knight of Loyola, though worn and
torn, was none the less fair for <span class="locked">that:&mdash;</span></p>

</div>

<p>For neither the violence of endurance, nor the vehemence
of energy, although begetting intensest fatigue,
is to be confounded with decay.</p>

<p>It was not decay, a century ago, when expropriation
and exile were the confessed policy of the courts
in Europe; when, as an American writer states it, in
Portugal "Pombal cut the Gordian knot.... He
commenced by the expulsion of the Jesuits and the
expropriation of their property." Nor is it decay in
the Order, when a liberal confederation in Switzerland,
on obtaining the political ascendency in 1848,
suppresses the Jesuit University at Fribourg, and provides
in this wise, as an American writer records:
"No religious society shall be allowed to teach; and
persons hereafter educated by the Jesuits, or by any
of the Orders affiliated to the Jesuits, shall be incapable
of holding office in Church or <span class="locked">State."<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></span> Policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
like this, whether in the countries "expurgated," or
in countries thereunto "affiliated," proves no decay
in the Order.</p>

<p>But where decay may come in has been clearly
pointed out by one of its Generals. Speaking of the
Education of Youth and the Promotion of Humane
Letters, Mutius Vitelleschi wrote, in 1639, "If ever
the Society were to decline from that lofty position
which it holds with so many provinces and peoples,
such an event could come about in no other way than
by failing to walk in the same steps, by which, with
the Divine Grace, it has acquired that high <span class="locked">esteem."<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></span></p>

<p>Those steps had been taken in various paths, of
which only two have concerned us here. For its men
of action were largely identified with the general history
of Europe; and its men of the word, who toiled
in apostolic work, at home or abroad, have entwined
their memories in the history of souls, often ungrateful,
yet always worthy of the toil. But its men of
the school did a work which we have sketched in a
general way, and which we shall analyze in the second
part of this essay; while its men of the pen deserve a
passing word of notice here.</p>

<p>They concern us from a pedagogic point of view, in
many ways. They wrote text-books, many of which
are the basis of manuals in almost every line of education
to-day, sometimes without the change of a
word, and generally without acknowledgment. Besides
that, their literary productions were, as a rule,
the offspring of their labors in the schools. It might
not be safe to estimate their standing as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">littérateurs</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
by the process which a Scotch Professor uses, who,
in the course of forty-seven elegant lectures on Rhetoric
and Belles Lettres, sees little occasion to recognize
the existence of this Jesuit school of literature,
except when he goes out of his way to salute Père
Rapin in a somewhat questionable <span class="locked">manner.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></span> Many
of those whom the Scottish Professor himself does
honor to, in his pages, were Jesuit scholars,&mdash;Bossuet,
Corneille, Molière, Tasso, Fontenelle, Didérot, Voltaire,
Bourdaloue, himself a Jesuit. It would be safer
then to determine the standing of these Professors,
who were in control of a great literary age, by looking
at the golden age itself, that of Louis XIV. The
majority of the brilliant figures, whom Dr. Blair
names as illustrating the <span class="locked">epoch,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> were all Jesuit
scholars. Naturally, then, the fifty Professors of
the Jesuit College at Paris were, as Cardinal Maury
affirmed, a permanent tribunal of literature for all
men of letters, a high court of judicature, a focus of
public attention from which radiated the public opinion
of the capital; in short, as Piron had emphatically
said, "the Star-chamber of literary <span class="locked">reputations."<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span></p>

<p>Devoted as they were to an austere profession, we
may say of many among them, that they were not
themselves romancers of a lively fancy or great poets;
and so far agree with Voltaire, who made this very
remark about his old Professor, Père Porée. Yet also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
without inconsistency I believe, we may agree with
the spirit of Père Porée's rejoiner, when the remark
was reported to him, that "he was not one of the
great poets." The Jesuit replied, "At least you may
grant that I have been able to make some of them."</p>

<p>And, should results be gauged on a wider basis than
mere poetry, not a few of the most prominent men in
European history would seem to have been the outcome
of this system, men, too, who represented every
possible school and tendency, in their subsequent literary
and public life. A few names show this. There
are those of Descartes, Buffon, Justus Lipsius, Muratori,
Calderon, Vico, the jurisconsult, founder of the
philosophical school of history. There are Richelieu,
Tilly, Malesherbes, Don John of Austria, Luxembourg,
Esterhazy, Choiseul, with those of Saint Francis
de Sales, founder of a religious Order, Lambertini,
afterwards the most learned of Popes, under the name
of Benedict XIV, and the present Pontiff, Leo XIII,
also most erudite. These certainly represent many
schools and tendencies, and they come, with many
others, from the same <span class="locked">schools.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span></p>

<p>As authors of every kind, and in departments even
far remote from the regular courses of the schools,
Jesuit writers were, at the very least, so far related to
Jesuit teachers, that, as we see in the bibliographical
dictionary of the Society, all had been Professors,
with scarcely an exception; and almost all had professed
Humanities, Belles Lettres, Rhetoric.</p>

<p>When Father Nathaniel Southwell of Norfolk endeavored,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
in 1676, to compile a dictionary of these
authors, he recorded those whose works had the qualification
of a respectable bulk to recommend them.
He entered the names and works of 2240 authors
who answered this description. This was 136 years
after the foundation of the Order. The enterprise
was repeatedly taken in hand afterwards. The
possibility of ever accomplishing it was much jeopardized
by the Suppression. But at length the
two Fathers De Backer published a series of seven
quarto volumes, in the years 1853&ndash;1861; and this
first step they followed up, in the years 1869&ndash;1876,
with a new edition, in three immense folios, containing
the names of 11,100 authors. This number
does not include the supplements, with the names of
writers in the present century, and of the anonymous
and pseudonymous authors. Of this last category,
Father Sommervogel's researches, up to 1884, enabled
him to publish a catalogue, which fills a full octavo
volume of 600 pages, with double columns. The writers
of this century, whom the De Backers catalogued
in their supplement, fill 647 columns, folio, very small
print. Altogether, the three folios contain 7086 columns,
compressed with every art of typographical condensation.</p>

<p>Suarez of course is to be seen there, and Cornelius
à Lapide, Petau, and the Bollandists. A single name,
like that of Zaccaria, has 117 works recorded under
it, whereof the 116th is in 13 volumes quarto, and
the 117th in 22 volumes octavo. The Catechism of
Canisius fills nearly 11 columns with the notices of
its principal editions, translations, abridgments; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
commentaries upon it, and critiques. Rossignol has
66 works to his name. The list of productions about
Edmund Campian, for or against him, chiefly in
English, fills, in De Backers' folio, two and a half
columns of minutest print. Bellarmine, in Father
Sommervogel's new edition, fills 50 pages, double
<span class="locked">column.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span></p>

<p>Under each work are recorded the editions, translations,
sometimes made into every language, including
Arabic, Chinese, Indian; also the critiques, and the
works published in refutation&mdash;a controversial enterprise
which largely built up the Protestant theological
literature of the times, and, in Bellarmine's case
alone, meant the theological Protestant literature for
40 or 50 years afterwards. Oxford founded an anti-Bellarmine
chair. The editions of one of this great
man's works are catalogued by Sommervogel under
the distinct heads of 54 <span class="locked">languages.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span></p>

<p>In the methodical or synoptic table, at the end of
the De Backers' work, not only are the subjects well-nigh
innumerable, which have their catalogues of
authors' names attached to them, but such subjects too
are here as might not be expected. Thus "Military
Art" has 32 authors' names under it; "Agriculture"
11; "Navy" 12; "Music" 45; "Medicine" 28.</p>

<p>To conclude then our History of this Educational
Order, we have one synoptical view of it in these twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
or thirteen thousand authors, all of one family. We
have much more. This one work "attesting," as
De Backer says in his preface, "at one and the same
time a prodigious activity and often an indisputable
merit," whereof three and a half centuries have been
the course in time, and the whole world the place
and theatre, is a general record of religion, letters,
science, and education, in every country, civilized or
barbarous, where the Society of Jesus labored and
travelled. And where has it not done so? In many
parts of the world it was the first to occupy the
field with literary men, who then sent communications
to their superiors, or to learned societies, about the
manners of different countries, the state of religion
there, of letters, science, and education, including reports
of their own observations in geography, meteorology,
botany, astronomy, mineralogy, etc. Original
sources, from which later history in North, South, and
Central America is drawing materials, are seen
described here as they appeared; so too with regard
to Japan, China, Thibet, the Philippine Islands, Hindustan,
Syria, as also to-day with respect to the native
tongues of the North American Indians. Here
the record of published literature, described and
catalogued according to date, marks the stages of
mathematical and physical science, from the end
of the sixteenth century onwards, and of magnetic
and electrical researches all through last century;
as well as the relationship between the books of
Jesuit authors and similar or kindred ones, by persons
outside the Society, in different countries and of
divers religions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
In short, works composed in most of the tongues of
the world exhibit the chief periods in universal culture,
and the developments elaborated in the civilization
of <span class="locked">mankind.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span></p>

<p>So centralized an Order as the Society of Jesus,
which formed its Professors for every country, and
sent them from one place to another, undertook, in
doing so, to exhibit a definite system of education, of
courses, of method. Besides such a unity of method,
it professed also a consistent uniformity of doctrine.</p>

<p>Before its time there was no one method which
could be considered universal; because there was no
teaching body itself universal. The Order, as it
branched out into the world, found a variety of systems
in vogue; and the Jesuit Professors conformed, as
best they could, to the local traditions of populations
very diverse, in universities which were distinct and
mutually independent. But, while they endeavored
to better such systems, in accordance with the plan of
their own Constitution, it was clear that they fell
short of realizing the idea of their founder. Hence
variations and dispensations were part of the usual
order of the day.</p>

<p>Yet there is a best way of doing everything; and,
not least, in education. In such a best way, some
elements are essential at all times, while others are
accidental, and vary with time, place, and circumstance.
The ideal system will preserve in its integrity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
all that is essential, and then will adapt the general
principles with the closest adjustment to the particular
environment.</p>

<p>Besides the unity of method desired, which I may define
to be <i>the best way best adjusted to circumstance</i>, there
was need, as I have just said, of a consistent uniformity
of doctrine; lest, in the same chair of philosophy, of
divinity, or of science, or in chairs placed side by side,
one Professor should say Yea to a question, and another
Nay to the same question, with no more material a reason
evident for the difference, save that one taught here
and the other there, one spoke yesterday, the other
speaks to-day. The educational effects, however, are
far from being immaterial; for, contradictory statements
eliding one another, it is quite possible that
the students understand less the next day than the
day before. And, as to the Professors themselves,
nothing can imperil more the harmony and efficiency
of an educational organization, than disagreement of
opinion in the function and act of teaching. In philosophy,
the occasions for dispute spring off at every
turn. Theology, as every one knows, is made to
bristle with them. And, among men who are themselves
educated to the highest degree of mental culture,
interests and questions like these are far more
absorbing than money, place, or power elsewhere. If
anywhere ideas rule, it is among men of profound
thought; as the intense intellectuality of the mediæval
universities had shown, with all the consequences of
unlimited vagaries in an unbridled scholasticism; or,
again, as the whole history of the intellectual Greek
world had evidenced, whether in the early ages of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
Christian Church, or in the heathen generations before.</p>

<p>Whatever, then, a man may think privately, and be
free to think, in matters of mere opinion, the genius
of education imposes limits on the manner and matter
of his actual teaching; and the speculations of a
thinker, a writer, or an investigator, are not to be
confounded with the best results of an educator,
who, doing his work in the best way, is to effect a
definite and immediate object. That object is nothing
less than the equipping of fresh young spirits with
principles of thought and habits of life, to enter
fully appointed on their respective paths of duty. In
this view, therefore, definiteness of matter, no less
than unity of method, were required from the first for
an effective system of education.</p>

<p>During forty years, the individual enterprise of
experienced and responsible men had been interpreting
the values and measuring the results of existing
methods. The Society itself had mounted into such
a position, as practically to command the whole field
of secular education. Its own system must have been
excellent already. Nor could that system have been
uniformly excellent, but for some uniformity which
characterized it. Still the unity was defective. The
Provinces were petitioning for an improvement. Evils
obstructed the way to something better. For these
reasons, the matter was taken in hand by one General
after another. And the final outcome of their
work was a "Form," or "Method of Studies," <i>Formula</i>,
or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth day of February, 1581, Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Claudius Aquaviva was elected fifth General Superior
of the Society. Taking up this educational project
where his predecessors had left it, and, like them,
availing himself of his almost boundless resources for
obtaining information, he began by putting the work
through every possible stage of consultation, to which
the traditions of his office, and his own executive ability
prompted him; and, when all prudent means had
been exhausted in deliberating, he then used the executive
power which was vested in him; and he required
that what had been so laboriously designed, by the
united efforts of many, should henceforth be reduced
to practice, with the good will of all.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to review briefly the process
of elaboration. In the general assembly which
elected Aquaviva, a committee of twelve Fathers from
different countries was appointed to draw up a method
of studies. How far their work proceeded does not
appear. Three years later, in 1584, the General
named a Commission of six, John Azor from Spain,
Gaspar Gonzalez from Portugal, Peter Buys from
Austria, Anthony Guisani from Upper Germany,
Stephen Tucci of Rome, and James Tyre to represent
France. This last-named Jesuit, a Scotchman, was
not unknown in the lists of controversy to his countryman,
John Knox. They were all experienced in
the administration of colleges, and versed in the subjects
of all the faculties. Entering on their labors,
they worked during six winter months in the Pœnitentiaria
of St. Peter's in Rome; and, during the next
three summer months, they resided in the Quirinal.
The eyes of the chief authorities in the Catholic world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
were turned in expectancy towards them. Indeed,
some of the chief interests of Catholic Christendom
seemed to depend upon them.</p>

<p>They spent three hours a day in consultation. The
rest of their time they devoted to consulting authors
and conning over methods, in the three fields of
letters, philosophy, and divinity. The documents
which they studied are enumerated by themselves as
being the minutes of previous deliberations held at
Rome, or in the more prominent colleges of the Order;
the letters, consultations and laws of the universities,
and other such documents, sent at different times up
to that date from Italy, Spain, France, Germany,
Poland; the fourth part of the Constitution, as the
standard of guidance; the canons of the general assemblies;
the rules and statutes of the schools; moreover,
the customs and regulations of the Roman <span class="locked">College.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span></p>

<p>After nine months of consecutive labor, they presented
the results to the General, in August, 1585.
Father Aquaviva submitted the document for examination
to the Professors of the Roman College. Then
he took the whole matter under his own personal consideration,
with his four General Assistants, who represented
each a certain number of Provinces. At this
stage, the report was printed, not as a rule determined
on, but as the preliminary outline of a rule. The
copies struck off were few, just enough for the use of
the Provinces. The General's letter, which accompanied
the report, defined the precise stage at which
the process was now understood to <span class="locked">be.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
He says that, in a matter of such grave and universal
consequence, it was not his intention to prescribe
anything, without first learning the opinions of the
chief Doctors of the Society. Accordingly, he had
been content with reading the results of the Commission's
labors, decreeing nothing, changing nothing, except
so far as was necessary to put it in shape for
distribution. He now required the Provincial Superiors,
immediately upon receipt of the present letter,
to select at least five men, who were the best qualified
in point of learning and judgment, along with other
members, who were eminent in literature, and whom the
Provincial might think fit to convoke. To these the
report was to be submitted, for each to examine privately,
and with great care. On certain days, several
times in the week, they were to meet and hold consultations;
to put their conclusions in writing, as
well with regard to the practical method of studies,
as with regard to the speculative opinions which they
favored; they were to note whatever they thought
should be added, or be made clearer, or otherwise regulated,
for the greater perfection of the work. If
any of the Fathers, designated for this Provincial
committee, could not possibly attend the meetings,
still they were to send their opinions in writing to the
Fathers actually in session; so that full account might
be taken of the public opinion in that Province. The
criterion they were to follow, in making up their minds,
was not so much their own private sentiment or their
own leaning this way or that, as the general good of
the whole Society, the practice of the universities
and schools, and, in fine, the judgment of Doctors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
most approved for their authority and solidity of
doctrine.</p>

<p>Aquaviva refers to the idea and intention of Ignatius
with respect to the present undertaking; and he
adds: "I would have all steadfastly keep this object
in view, that they endeavor to find out reasons, not
how a final decree may be prevented, as if the enterprise
were hard, and could not possibly be carried out
(for we have made up our mind to carry it out, since
it is necessary, and is recommended by the Constitution);
but how the difficulties, if any such there be,
may disappear, and the whole Order may combine in
one and the same arrangement; for otherwise the
final result would only be the greater detriment of
the Society."</p>

<p>He calls their attention to an important point, in
what is now styled Pedagogics, or the Science of Education.
It is, that, in the form now sent out, the
Fathers had taken pains to explain their reasons for
arriving at conclusions. That would not be done in
the System to be drawn up later, which would contain
only the statement of directions for all to follow.
In these words, we have a most important distinction
laid down between the science which underlies the
system of education, and the practical method itself
which rests upon the science. The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>,
as subsequently promulgated, is a practical method.
The science is sketched, as need arises, in the preliminary
<i>Ratio</i> of 1586.</p>

<p>At the same time, Father Aquaviva despatched
another letter, about which he says, in a postscript to
the foregoing, that the six points provisionally laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
down in it are to be subjected to the same examination
as the preliminary <i>Ratio</i> itself.</p>

<p>In this supplementary epistle, he premises that it
will require much time and consideration to issue the
final code of rules; and therefore, as a direction for
the time being, he issues the <span class="locked">following:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>First, Professors shall adhere to St. Thomas Aquinas
as their standard in theology.</p>

<p>Secondly, they shall take care, in their manner of
teaching, always to consolidate faith and piety.</p>

<p>Thirdly, he lays down a principle of still wider
application, and one which seems vital in the whole
theory and practice of teaching: "Let no one defend
any opinion which is judged by the generality of
learned men to go against the received tenets of
philosophers and theologians, or the common consent
of theological schools." This touches a vital element
in education. If we suppose that the teacher's art
lies, not in giving forth the lucubrations of his own
private thoughts and theories, but in imparting solid
results, approved and ascertained, to those who come
for such results, and wish to receive them in the most
approved way, then the Professor in his chair ought
not to mistake himself for the author in his study,
nor should he practise on living men, whose life is all
before them, what he might, with more propriety,
first practise on the leisured world, and test elsewhere,
either in the printed page, or in conference with his
equals. The Professor, as such, is not the original
investigator. In mathematics, he is notoriously not
so. In that branch, the best teacher is the man who
walks along a definite line, turns neither to the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
nor left, and finishes in a definite time; or else his
scholars will never finish. To a certain degree, the
same holds in all courses. If a man is theorizing,
when he ought to be instructing, he goes off the line
of perfect system, however much pains he takes with
his matter; just as much as if, taking no pains whatever,
he neglected his matter altogether, went behind
it, or around it, gave histories of his branch, methods
of teaching it, and descanted on pedagogics, to young
people who were never sent to him for that purpose.
They are sent to learn definite matter, and to be
formed therein on a good plan, by the man who understands
it. Then, as Loyola said in another connection,
"when they have experienced in themselves the
effects thereof," they will be qualified for all the rest,
for understanding the plan itself on which they have
been formed, and enjoying all the practical results of
it; and, if their line of life invites, for understanding
other plans too. This is practical wisdom in education;
neither dilettantism nor speculation.</p>

<p>Fourthly, Aquaviva lays down a principle regarding
the public advocacy of opinions. He is not
referring to authorities denouncing, or Professors
repudiating, them; but merely to certain conditions
for putting them forward: "If opinions, no matter
whose they be, are found in a certain province or city
to give offence to many Catholics, whether members
of the Society or not, that is, persons not unqualified
to judge, let no one teach them or defend them there,
albeit the same doctrines may be taught elsewhere
without offence." The word "defence," in a context
like this, means publishing and sustaining theses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
against all comers in public disputations; wherein the
Professor represents the school, and the school is put
to the account of the Order. The principle seems
discreet. If a corporate body does not want to be
compromised, it is not for the member to compromise
it. If he wants to use the perfect freedom of his
opinions, and deliver himself of his own pronouncements,
he ought first to assure himself that his circumstances
are such as to set him free from representing
others. This is an elementary principle of social and
urbane existence.</p>

<p>The fifth point concerns the march of improvement
in the advancement of opinions. It describes the
method of discreet development: "In questions which
have already been treated by others, let no one follow
new opinions, or, in matters which in any way pertain
to religion, or are of some consequence, let no one introduce
new questions, without consulting the Prefect
of Studies, or the Superior. If, then, it still remains
dubious, whether the new opinion, or the new question,
is permissible, it will be proper for the said
authority, in order that things may proceed more
smoothly, to learn the judgment of others in the
Society upon the subject; and then he will determine
what appears best for the greater glory of God." In
the sixth and last point, Aquaviva calls attention to a
former decree, upon the manner of treating the Aristotelian
<span class="locked">philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span></p>

<p>So much for this letter of Aquaviva. On the sense
and purport thereof he invited the communication of
views from the Order at large, as well as on the document<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
which he encloses, the preliminary <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>.
To this we may now turn our attention.</p>

<p>The six Fathers, who drew it up, state, in their introduction,
that there are two mainstays and supports
of the Society of Jesus, "an ardent pursuit of piety
and an eminent degree of learning," <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ardens pietatis
studium et præstans rerum scientia</i>. If piety is not
illumined with the light of learning, it can be, no
doubt, of great use to the person who possesses it, but
of scarcely any use in the service of the Church and
of one's neighbor, in the administration of the Word
and of the Sacraments, in the education of youth, in
controversies with those who are hostile to the faith,
in giving counsel, answering doubts, and in all other
offices and functions, which are proper to men of the
Order. All these call for an endowment of learning
not common, but excelling in its degree.</p>

<p>To acquire such learning, it is of supreme consequence
that we set before ourselves what path we
enter on, what arts we employ, and what means we
use; because, unless a ready and tried method be
adopted, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ratio facilis ac solers</i>, much labor is spent in
gathering but little fruit; whereas, if the labor of
studies be guided by some sage rule, great results are
compendiously obtained, at the cost of little research.</p>

<p>Then the Commission goes on to say: "We have undertaken
to teach, not only members of the Order, but
youth from the world outside. The number of this
latter class is vast; it includes brilliant talent, and
represents the nobility. We cannot imagine that we
do justice to our functions, or come up to the expectations
formed of us, if we do not feed this multitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
of youths, in the same way as nurses do, with food
dressed in the best way, for fear they grow up in our
schools, without growing much in learning. An additional
spur is felt in the circumstance, that whatever
concerns us is public and, day after day, is before the
eyes of all, even of those who are not well disposed
towards us." The Fathers consider it unnecessary to
enlarge upon that harmony of views, so much commended
in the Constitution, as to matters of public
policy or teaching; they say, "sufficient regard could
not, up to this, be paid to such harmony; for, when
no common order or form was as yet prescribed, every
one thought that he could hold what sentiments he
liked, and teach them to others in the manner he himself
preferred; so that sometimes the members of the
Order disagreed as much among themselves, as with
others <span class="locked">outside."<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span></p>

<p>After describing, in vivid terms, the manner in
which they had conducted their deliberations, and
arrived at conclusions, and how, when any keen dispute
had arisen among <span class="locked">them,<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span> they had divided and
distinguished the disputed matter, and had examined
it during two and even three days, till they came to
settle at last on what all of them accepted, the critics
come to the Practice and Order of <span class="locked">Studies;<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span> and
upon this they enlarge, in successive chapters, under
the following <span class="locked">heads:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Sacred Scriptures. The Length of the Course
in Divinity. The Means of finishing that Course in
Four Years. The Method of Lecturing. The Questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
which are either not to be treated by the Theological
Professors, or are to be treated only at a Certain
Part of the Course. Repetitions. Disputations. The
Choice, Censorship, and Correcting of Opinions. The
Private Studies of Students. Vacations. The Degrees
of Bachelor, Master, Doctor. Controversial Theology.
Moral Theology. Hebrew. The Study of Philosophy,
which includes Physics. Mathematics. Literature,
that is, Grammar, History, Poetry, Rhetoric.
Seminaries for Literature and the Higher Faculties.
The Professors of Literature. The Grammar to be
used. Greek. Different Exercises in the Classics.
Incitements to Study. The Method of Promotion.
Books. Vacations in the Lower Classes. Order and
Piety. The Respective Objects and Exercises of the
Classes of Grammar and Humanity. The Class of
Humanity. The Class of Rhetoric. General Distribution
of Time during the Year.</p>

<p>These are the matters handled in the publication of
1586. In the course of treatment, this document contains,
by way of a running commentary, the complete
theory of Education, or Science of Pedagogics, as understood
by these critics. It will not be possible,
within the brief limits of this work, to give more
than a bare sketch of the pedagogical elements contained
in the one hundred and fifty pages of the
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Monumenta Germaniæ Pædagogica</i>.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>A second, partial edition of this preliminary <i>Ratio</i>
was sent out by Father Aquaviva, in 1591, to which an
entertaining bibliographical history is <span class="locked">attached.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span> In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
1593, the fifth general assembly of the Order met,
Claudius Aquaviva presiding. By this time, during
the interval of seven years which had elapsed since
the first edition, the book had been subjected to examination
in all the Provinces; observations and criticisms
had been returned; it had been re-committed to
the Fathers at Rome, and revised by the General with
his Assistants; and had again been sent out for trial.
The Provincials and Deputies, meeting in 1593, brought
with them the reports of how the system worked. Its
slightest defects were <span class="locked">noted.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> Most asked for an
abridged form.</p>

<p>Amid the very grave questions then pending, the
assembly took some action on the <i>Ratio</i>. It was re-committed
once more to the competent authorities for
revision. And it assumed its last and definite form,
in what was probably its ninth edition. This last
issue, in the year 1599, after fifteen years spent on the
elaboration of it, is the RATIO STUDIORUM.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-seven years later, the
great old University of Paris seems to have become
a disciple of its educational rival, the Society of
Jesus. Querard observes that the Rector, Rollin,
"without saying anything about it, translated the
<i>Ratio</i> for his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Traité des Études</i>."<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> Indeed, as M. Bréal,
historian of that University, observes, referring to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
suppression of the Order: "Once delivered from the
Jesuits, the University installed itself in their houses,
and continued their manner of <span class="locked">teaching."<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span></p>

<p>In all general works on education, there is question
of this System. Its form is that of a practical
method, without reasons being assigned, or arguments
urged. It is a legislative document, which superseded
all previous forms. The General's letter, which accompanied
it, ordered the suppression of them all,
promulgating this one to the exclusion of the rest.</p>

<p>The sentiment, to which the last words of this
letter gives expression as a fond hope, was fully responded
to by the course of events, in the one hundred
and seventy-four years which were to elapse
before the general suppression of the Order: "It is
believed," he said, "that it will bring forth abundant
fruit, for the benefit of our scholars," <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Quae nostris
auditoribus uberes fructus allatura creditur</i>. Aquaviva's
letter is dated the eighth day of January, <span class="locked">1599.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead">FORMATION OF THE MASTER. HIS COURSES OF LITERATURE
AND PHILOSOPHY.</span></h2>

<p>It seems an apt distribution of our subject, to
consider, first, the formation of the Master, and
secondly, the formation of the Scholar. The Master's
development will conduct us chiefly through the
higher studies; the Scholar's, rather through the
lower. Thus the two persons, about whom the science
of education revolves, will be directly under inspection;
while the elements which go to form them will,
at the same time, pass under review.</p>

<p>Without theorizing on pedagogy, the Jesuit system
itself, merely as observed and realized, results in the
formation of Professors. There are several reasons,
apparent on the surface, why it should do so. The
studies, which the members of the Order pursue, are
the same courses as the Order professes for the world
at large. But, for the Jesuit members of the divers
courses, a most elaborate system of examinations at
every stage, with a specially searching manner of
testing the students, is made to regard one objective
point, which is the capacity of the Jesuit to teach
what he has learnt, and this, as evinced, while under
examination. The manner, in which this point is
judicially determined, consists in referring the examiners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
to a standard, called "mediocrity." After a
personal and oral disputation with the young Jesuit,
lasting either half an hour, or one hour, or two consecutive
hours, according to the stage at which he
happens to be, a preponderating vote of the four or
five examining Professors must aver that he has
"surpassed mediocrity." The learning, prudence, and
sincerity of the examiners are appealed to without
further sanction, except at the very last stage in the
young man's progress, when success under the ordeal
will entitle him to Profession in the Society. Then
each examiner's prudence is stimulated, and his sincerity
bound down, by an oath. Only at one initial
stage, that of the first examination in the course of
his three years' Philosophy, is a certain margin allowed
the beginner, in favor of bare mediocrity.</p>

<p>"Mediocrity" is defined to be that degree of intelligence,
and comprehension of the matters studied,
which can give an account of them to one asking an
explanation. "To surpass mediocrity" designates
the student's ability to defend his entire ground
with such erudition and facility as show him qualified,
in point of actual attainments, to profess the
philosophy or theology studied. The final degree in
the Order, which is that of Profession, requires this
competency for all Philosophy and Theology together.
Here then we see, that the capacity to teach is made
the criterion of having learned sufficiently well.
Passing through all the grades with this mark of excellence,
the man who, after a general formation of
seventeen years, and the requisite development of
other qualifications, is then appointed to profess in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
chair of the higher faculties, has been very much to
the manner born of "surpassing mediocrity," and of
doing so with the characteristics of a <span class="locked">Professor.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span> How
the same principles, if not in the same form, affect the
conduct of the literary curriculum, we shall now see
in the rest of this chapter.</p>

<p>The literary curriculum has been already finished
by the Jesuit, before entering the Order. But, after
his admission, special means are taken to have him
revise those studies, extend them, and grasp them from
the standpoint of the teacher. It happens in Jesuit
history, and the nature of secondary education will
always have it so, that the largest amount of teaching
has been done in the arena of these literary courses.
And it was no small part of the general revival of
studies, effected by Ignatius of Loyola, that justice
was done to literature, as well by students who were
to enter on philosophical or scientific <span class="locked">courses,<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span> as by
those who contemplated embarking on life in the world.
We noticed, on a former occasion, the reasoning of Aquaviva
with respect to this <span class="locked">policy.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span> The literary courses in
question are those of Grammar, Humanities, and Rhetoric,
which fill from five to seven years. The Fathers of
1586 urge the importance of these studies for the
English and German students in Rome, as if special
difficulties were experienced with <span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
If we inquire what were the results of the stringent
regulations adopted to enforce this policy, and what
degree of proficiency was attained in the Jesuit
courses of Belles-Lettres and eloquence, we have only
to consult the concordant testimony of history upon the
"handsome style" and literary finish of the scholars.
An interesting answer, from a domestic point of view,
is casually afforded us by a remark, which the Fathers
of Upper Germany make, when in 1602 they send to
Aquaviva some animadversions of theirs upon the
<i>Ratio</i>. They say that students in the class of
Rhetoric might deliver their own orations, "since there
are generally found in that class, particularly among
those of the second year, young men who often surpass
even their own Professors in genius, and in the
variety and fluency of their <span class="locked">language."<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span></p>

<p>The bearing of all this is obvious, in determining
the grade of those students who ask for admission
into the Order. It is after a full gymnasium course
of this kind, that the life of the Jesuit is to begin.
And these are the studies which he will have to possess
after the manner of a teacher. He will review
them as soon as his two years of novitiate are over.</p>

<p>Those years of novitiate are blank, under the aspect
of secular pursuits. But, in other respects, being a
time for reflection and for internal application to the
affairs of his mind and heart, they are worth a long
season in the process of developing character, by
habits of assiduous labor, of acquiring a taste for retirement
and virtue, and practising the spirit of docility
to counsel. Indeed, on issuing from this period of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
intense application to the knowledge of self, the
young religious student is already started on his
career of knowing men, and dealing successfully with
human characters. Henceforth, ecclesiastical knowledge
and other acquirements will be proper to his
state, as a Religious; but, for the special vocation of
the Society of Jesus, he returns to secular studies.</p>

<p>In view of his approaching "regency," or Professorship
in the curriculum of letters, the critics of 1586
give this advice: "It would be most profitable for the
schools, if those who are about to be Preceptors were
privately taken in hand by some one of great experience;
and, for two months or more, were practised
by him in the method of reading, teaching, correcting,
writing, and managing a class. If teachers have not
learnt these things beforehand, they are forced to
learn them afterwards at the expense of their scholars;
and then they will acquire proficiency only when
they have already lost in reputation; and perchance
they will never unlearn a bad habit. Sometimes, such
a habit is neither very serious nor incorrigible, if
taken at the beginning; but, if the habit is not corrected
then, it comes to pass that a man, who otherwise
would have been most useful, becomes well-nigh
useless. There is no describing how much amiss Preceptors
take it, if they are corrected, when they have
already adopted a fixed method of teaching; and what
continual disagreement ensues on that score with the
Prefects of Studies. To obviate this evil, in the case
of our Professors, let the Prefect in the chief College,
whence our Professors of Humanities and Grammar
are usually taken, remind the Rector and Provincial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
about three months before the next scholastic year
begins, that, if the Province needs new Professors for
the following term, they should select some one eminently
versed in the art of managing classes, whether
he be, at the time, actually a Professor, or a student of
Theology or Philosophy; and to him the future Masters
are to go daily for an hour, to be prepared by him
for their new ministry, giving prelections in turn,
writing, dictating, correcting, and discharging the other
duties of a good <span class="locked">teacher."<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span></p>

<p>This advice was in keeping with an ordinance of
the second general assembly, held in 1565, nine years
after the death of Ignatius. It had been resolved,
that at least one perfect Seminary of the Society
should be established in each Province for the formation
of Professors and others, who would be competent
workmen in the vineyard of Christ, in the
department of Humane Letters, Philosophy, and Theology,
so as to suffice for the needs of the whole Province.
This was to be done as soon as convenient in
each Province.</p>

<p>Henceforward, it became a matter of general observance
that all should have spent "at least two years
in the school of eloquence," besides repeating grammar,
if that were <span class="locked">necessary.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span> "And if any are so
gifted as to promise great success in these pursuits,
it will be worth while seeing whether they should not
spend three years in them, to lay a more solid foundation."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span><a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a>
To such a solid foundation in Humane Letters
corresponds a special privilege in the crowning of
a member's formation, inasmuch as the Society admits
to Profession one who is altogether eminent in literature,
even though in Theology he may not have surpassed
mediocrity; a privilege which was extended to
great proficiency in the Indian and Oriental languages,
as also to a marked excellence in Greek and <span class="locked">Hebrew.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span></p>

<p>Examining more in detail this literary formation,
we may take up the programme for the seminary of
the junior members, as drafted by Jouvancy. He drew
it up in pursuance of a decree to that effect, passed
a hundred years later, by the general assembly of
1696. This decree required that, "besides the rules,
whereby the Masters of Literature are directed in the
manner of teaching, they should be provided with an
Instruction and Method of learning properly, and so
be guided in their private studies even while they are
actually <span class="locked">teaching."<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span> The method in question is outlined
in the first part of Jouvancy's little book, entitled
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Discendi et Docendi</i>, "The art of Learning
and of Teaching." A cursory glance at this part shows
that, while addressing Masters on the subject of their
own private studies, his directions bear chiefly upon
their efficiency as teachers.</p>

<p>Jouvancy divides his subject into three chapters:
first, the knowledge and use of languages; secondly,
the possession of sciences; thirdly, some aids to study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
As to languages, they are three in number: Greek,
Latin, and the native tongue. Laying down some
principles on style in general, he says: "If a correct
understanding, according to Horace, be the first principle
and source of writing well, it follows that style,
which is nothing else than a certain manner of writing,
has two parts; first, the intelligent thought or
sentiment, properly conceived; secondly, the expression
of the same; so that, as man himself is made up
of soul and body, all style likewise consists of the
underlying thought and the manner of its expression."
Thought must be true, perspicuous, and adapted to the
subject. To think truly or justly of things, there is
required mental power and insight, which distinguishes
what is really the gist of a subject-matter
from what is only a deceptive appearance, or is superficial.
Assistance is to be had for all this from the
reading of good books, from accurate reflection and
protracted thought, which does not merely skim over
the subject, or touch it in a desultory way; again,
from the analysis of parts, causes, adjuncts; finally,
from the prudent judgment of others, or what is called
criticism. As to the ways of acquiring proper diction,
Jouvancy says: "I would have you avail yourself
of books which treat of this matter, not so as
to imagine all is done by thumbing them; you will
gain much more by the plentiful reading of the best
writers"; and again, "'abundance of diction,' <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">copia
verborum</i>, will be easily acquired by reading much."
It is by reading, writing, and imitating the best
authors that a good style is formed; and only the
best authors are to be read, "lest the odor of a foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
and vicious style cling to the mind, as to new
vases."</p>

<p>Coming to treat of one's native tongue, Jouvancy
lays down these points: "The study of the vernacular
consists chiefly in three things. First, since the
Latin authors are explained to the boys, and are rendered
into the mother-tongue, the version so made
should be as elegant as possible. Wherefore, let the
master elaborate his version for himself, or, if he
draws on any writer in the vernacular, let him compare
first the Latin text with the version before him;
thus he will find it easy to perceive what is peculiar
to either tongue, and what is the respective force
and beauty of each. The same method is to be observed
in explaining and translating histories in the
lower classes. Secondly, all the drafts of compositions,
which are dictated in the vernacular, must be in accord
with the most exact rules of the mother-tongue,
free from every defect of style. [Thirdly,] it will be
of use to bring up and discuss, from time to time,
whatever has been noticed in the course of one's reading,
and whatever others have observed regarding the
vicious and excellent qualities of speech. The younger
Master should be on his guard against indulging too
much in the reading of vernacular authors, especially
the poets, to the loss of time, and perhaps to the
prejudice of virtue."</p>

<p>The interest here manifested in the vicious and
excellent qualities of the mother-tongue was a contribution
of the schools to the development of modern
languages. Nor was the severity, which is here prescribed,
with reference to the use of poetry, a barrier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
to the formation of some good poets among the Jesuits
themselves. Friedrich von Spee is considered a
distinguished lyric poet of the seventeenth century.
Denis, as the translator of Ossian into German, helped
to inaugurate the later period of German literature.
In Italian prose, Bartoli, Segneri, Pallavicini, have
ranked as classics; Tiraboschi, as the historian of
literature; Bresciani, in our days, as the popular novelist.
As writers of French prose, Bourdaloue and
Bouhours appertain to the choicest circle of Louis
XIV's golden age; Du Cygne, Brumoy, Tournemine,
besides others already mentioned in these pages, took
their place as literary critics. And, in their several
national literatures, Cahours, Martin, Garucci, have
attained their literary eminence as art-critics.</p>

<p>Reverting to solidity of thought as the basis of
style, Jouvancy eliminates the false ornaments of a
subtle and abrupt style, by reducing the conceptions
to a dialectical analysis: "What does the thing
mean?" And he gives examples.</p>

<p>In the second chapter of the same part, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ars
Discendi</i>, he comes to the acquisition of those sciences,
which are proper to a Master of Literature. He says:
"The erudition of a religious master is not confined to
mere command of languages, whereof we have spoken
heretofore; it must rise higher to the understanding
of some sciences, which it is usual to impart to youth.
Such are Rhetoric, Poetry, History, Chronology, Geography,
and Philology or Polymathy, which last is not
so much a single science as a series of erudite attainments,
whereof an accomplished person should at
least have tasted." History he divides into Sacred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Universal, and Particular. "As to the histories of
particular nations, writers of the respective nationalities
record them;" "and if you do not add Chronology
to History, you take out one of History's eyes." For
Geography, he designates the books and maps which
were then to be had. And, for all the branches, he
indicates standard authors.</p>

<p>Now, in this little rhetorical sketch of Jouvancy's,
we may take note of two features, one pedagogical,
the other historical. The distinctively pedagogical cast
is put upon these private studies, in as much as they
are magisterial, being pursued with express reference
to the Master's chair. The historical feature, to be
noted here, is common to the Jesuit educational literature
in general; which, in its many departments,
marked several epochs and, as a whole, made an era
in education.</p>

<p>Thus, at the time of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>, there
were indeed several guides of the very first rank, in
the path of a literary formation. They were three in
number, Cicero, Quintilian, and Aristotle. From these
the Professor of Rhetoric had to derive his matter and
make clear his method. The <i>Ratio</i> names them as
his text-books for the <span class="locked">Precepts.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span> From these sources
the literary activity and experience of many generations
of Professors, in several hundred colleges of the
Order, tended to mark out the best line to follow,
for the attainment of literary perfection. The literary
course, in which they themselves were proximately
formed for the duties of teaching, served but to organize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the matter, and to digest it. The numberless
pedagogical text-books, issued before Jouvancy, and
after him, exhibit the progress of the movement during
the several centuries. And, at present, the system
may be seen in its most developed form, if one
consults the newest guides, like Father Kleutgen's
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ars Dicendi</i>, or Father Broeckaert's <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le Guide du
Jeune Littérateur</i>. But, long before our day, the
most ordinary systems of literary instruction have
embodied the method; and the commonest text-books
have it.</p>

<p>A similar epoch was made, as early as 1572, by the
Grammar of Father Emmanuel Alvarez, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Institutione
Grammatica Libri Tres</i>, a work adopted by the <i>Ratio</i>,
then republished in editions so numerous as to baffle
all calculation, translated either entire, or in part, into
thirteen languages; while one portion, well-known in
our times as a "Latin Prosody," is credited to divers
authors or <span class="locked">publishers.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span> The latest editions of this
Grammar, issued in different languages, are of the
last twenty-five years. This era of development in
grammar superseded the subtleties and metaphysical
abstractions of mediæval <span class="locked">methods.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span></p>

<p>In history, not to mention the voluminous James
Sirmond, whose researches among original sources
were made before the sixteenth century had closed,
Father Denis Petau (Petavius), early in the following
century, composed his great work on Chronology, laying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
down the exact basis in this respect for Universal
History, both sacred and <span class="locked">profane.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span> Geneva and Holland
alike reproduced the work. Labbe's publications
on ancient and modern History and Chronology, the
greater part of his eighty works being upon these
subjects, with several abridgments and geographical
adjuncts; Father Buffier's "Practical History," which
was published for the schools in 1701, and then rapidly
went through divers editions, to be supplemented in
1715 by his "Universal Geography," his treatise on the
Globe and his Maps, all of which went through some
scores of French, Italian and Dutch editions; these
and other works of the kind indicate the line of
pedagogical development going on at the same time
in the various colleges. Hence, the "New Elements
of History and Geography for the use of the Scholars
of the Collège Louis-le-Grand," which was an abridgment
of Buffier's book, could say, with some propriety,
on its first page: "How great has been the carelessness
of an age, otherwise so judicious and cultivated
as ours, in not having as yet made the science of
History and Geography an essential part of the education
of youth? The public and posterity will perhaps
be grateful to the College of Louis-le-Grand, for
having shown in this regard an example, which ought
to do honor to our <span class="locked">time."<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span> Thus the same resources
were at the service of Jesuit education as, in the general
literary world, helped to form the Jesuit historians:
Mariana, historian of Spain; Damian Strada, of the
War in the Netherlands; Balbin, of Bohemia; Naruszewicz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
of Poland; Katona, of the Kings of Hungary;
Damberger, of the Middle Ages; Francis
Wagner, of Leopold I; G. Daniel, historiographer
royal of France.</p>

<p>Geography is not to be separated from History.
Up to the end of the sixteenth century, Ptolemy's
Geography, corrected, modified, altered, according to
the reports of navigators, had been the scientific
standard, but uncertain, vacillating, and self-contradictory.
From the earlier part of the seventeenth
century, the astronomical observations, sent from the
far East by the Jesuit missionaries, emphasized the
need of a general reform, already sufficiently evident.
Father Riccioli, assisted by Father Grimaldi, who is
known in science as one of the precursors of Newton,
undertook, in his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Geographia Reformata</i>, the reform
of Geography by means of <span class="locked">Astronomy.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span> For this
purpose, he created first his own metrology, identifying,
and reducing to a common denomination, all the
measures received in reports from different parts of
the earth. The first eclipse of the moon which he
makes mention of, among his astronomical reports,
had been observed on the night of November 8, 1612,
by Father Scheiner at Ingolstadt and by Father
Charles Spinola at Nangasaki in Japan. At the
time that Riccioli was writing, the Jesuit missionaries
had multiplied in China. Adam Schall died
in 1666, holding the post of President of the Mathematical
Tribunal at Pekin; he was followed by Ferdinand
Verbiest; and then a long line of imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
astronomers of the Celestial Empire, Koegler, Hallerstein,
Seixas, Francesco, De Rocha, Espinha, continued
to send their reports, either to the colleges of
their respective Provinces, or to other mathematical
centres, or to the learned societies in Europe, whereof
not a few Jesuits were members. Meanwhile, scientific
returns from Hindustan, Siam, Thibet, on one
side of the globe, and from San Domingo on the other
side, poured into the Collège Louis-le-Grand, and
made of this educational centre an indispensable
auxiliary to the Bureau of Longitudes. All this, reacting
on education, was received with satisfaction by
the general world, and drew the pedagogic bodies
steadily, though with some difficulty, on the line of
progress. The University of Paris was quite tardy
in following up the steps of the <span class="locked">Jesuits.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></span></p>

<p>As to Mathematics in education, it is evident that
a similar process of development must have been the
history of this branch, with the limitation however,
that mathematical science has not been so nearly
created anew within these last centuries, as some
other departments. Father Christopher Clavius, "the
Euclid of his time," was engaged by Gregory XIII in
reforming the Calendar, the same which we use to-day;
he died in 1612. His death intervening, while his
complete works were being republished, Father Ziegler
superintended the new edition, till it was finished
in five tomes. Francis Coster, at Cologne, Hurtado
Perez, at Ingolstadt, Henry Garnet, an Englishman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
and Grienberger, successor of Clavius, both at Rome,
belonged, with other mathematicans of the Order, to
the sixteenth century. The writers of the preliminary
<i>Ratio</i>, 1586, require that, in a brief course of
Mathematics, "Euclid's Elements" "be seasoned always
with some application to Geography or the
Sphere"; then, in the following year, the rest of
Father Clavius' "Epitome of Practical <span class="locked">Arithmetic"<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></span> is
to be <span class="locked">finished;<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></span> and special courses are provided for
members of the Order, who give promise of <span class="locked">eminence.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></span></p>

<p>Indeed, whether as Professors of officers for the
army and navy, or as constructing and directing observatories,
the members pursued every branch of
Mathematics, pure and applied. Father L'Hoste's
"Treatise on Naval Evolutions" was used in the French
navy, as "the Book of the <span class="locked">Jesuit."<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></span> Of this book
the Count de Maistre writes quaintly in 1820: "An
English Admiral assured me less than ten years ago,
that he had received his first instructions in the 'Book
of the Jesuit.' If events are taken for results, there
is not a better book in the world!"<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> Eximeno, at the
school of Segovia, instructed young nobles in Mathematics
and the science of Artillery. And so, in general,
courses were provided, according as the needs of
respective localities required. The Republic of Venice
struck a gold medal in honor of Vincent Riccolati, the
Jesuit engineer, just as the King of Denmark honors
De Vico, the astronomer, with a gold medal struck in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
his honor, and having the words inscribed, "Comet
Seen, Jan. 24, <span class="locked">1846."<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span></p>

<p>Kircher, Boscovich, Pianciani, Secchi, Perry, honored
with the fellowship of so many learned and
scientific Academies, and exercising a distinct influence
to-day, either by the far-reaching effects of their
researches, or by their actual contact with science, may
be looked upon as belonging to our most recent <span class="locked">times.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span></p>

<p>It is remarked that to the Order was due the multiplication
of observatories, in the middle of last century.
Father Huberti superintended the building of
an observatory at Würzburg; Father Maximilian Hell,
the court astronomer, built one at Vienna. At Manheim,
a third was erected by Mayer and Metzger;
at Tyrnau, one by Keri; at Prague, another by Steppling;
one at the Jesuit College of Gratz; similarly
at Wilna, Milan, Florence, Parma, Venice, Brescia,
Rome, Lisbon, Marseilles, Bonfa. In short, Montucla
remarks: "In Germany and the neighboring countries,
there were few Jesuit colleges without an observatory.
They were to be found at Ingolstadt, Gratz,
Breslau, Olmütz, Prague, Posen, etc. Most of them
seem to have shared the fate of the Society; though
there are a few which survive the general <span class="locked">destruction."<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
These few indications go to illustrate the pedagogical
epochs made by the system of the Order. And
the young member, who is being formed to contribute
his own share towards carrying on the education of
the world, passes all these branches under review.
One of them, Mathematics, is conducted outside of
the philological seminary, which we have so far been
considering; it is left for his course of Philosophy,
which he will pursue during three years, before actually
embarking on the life of the class-room, or his
"regency." We may now suppose that the time has
arrived for his entering the class-room, as a Master
of Grammar and Elementary Literature.</p>

<p>When he does so, he has possessed himself, in that
philosophical triennium, of positive intellectual attainments,
neither meagre nor common. He has surveyed
the whole field of natural thought and investigation,
in the various branches, mental, physical, and ethical.
To enumerate them, there is Logic, including dialectics,
and the criteria, objective and subjective, of truth;
Ontology, or general metaphysics; Special Metaphysics,
in its three divisions:&mdash;Cosmology, which immediately
underlies physics, chemistry, and biology;
Psychology, which underlies all the anthropological
sciences about the human compound, its principles,
and the formation of its ideas; Natural Theology.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
All this is theoretic or speculative philosophy. There
is besides the science of moral life, which comprises
Ethics, Natural Right, and Social Right. Concurrent
with Philosophy, there has been a double course of
Physics and Chemistry, during one year, with a course
of higher Mathematics, varying from one year to
three; as well as a half-year's course of Geology, Astronomy,
and some other subsidiary matters. This is
the general formation. The principle which guides
individual cases was laid down by Ignatius in these
terms: "In the superior faculties, on account of the
great inequality of talents and age and other considerations,
the Rector of the University will consider
how much in each line individuals shall learn, and
how long they shall stay in the courses; although it
is better for those who are of the proper age, and who
have the requisite facility in point of talent, that
they should endeavor to advance and become conspicuous
in <span class="locked">all."<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span> During all this course of higher natural
sciences, some attention has still been paid to accessories;
literature has not been entirely neglected;
oratory has been practised, and poems presented on
stated occasions. And then the new Master is introduced
into his course of "regency."</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">YOUTHFUL MASTERS.</span></h2>

<p>When Ignatius of Loyola was governing the Society,
the multiplicity of affairs which he had to administer,
and the absorption of mind which they demanded, did
not prevent him from devoting to every minute element
the attention which it specially invited. Hence
he required the young Scholastics, who were reviewing
their literary studies at Valencia, to send him
their orations and a poem. So, too, with the Masters
of the lower classes at Messina, in Sicily. This college
had opened with the higher courses of letters; but the
very next year such numerous throngs of younger
boys came asking for admission, that the system,
begun with Rhetoric and Humanities, was carried
down to meet their needs; and the entire course was
distributed into five grades. Ignatius required the
teachers of these lower grades, no less than those of
the higher, to write each week, and send him an account
of the affairs of his <span class="locked">class.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span></p>

<p>It is indeed an eventful moment, when a man becomes
a teacher of others. They may be boys. But,
whether they are boys merely blossoming into life, or
youths on the verge of manhood, the teacher of them
has to be a teacher of men; and perhaps more so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
with the boy than with the man, inasmuch as his control
of the younger student has to be so much the
more complete. It is not merely such a control as
will address the intellects of men mature, whose characters
are already far advanced in the way of formation,
or are perhaps fixed for life; but it must be such
as will form a whole human nature, which is still
pliable and docile.</p>

<p>As an almost universal rule, the Jesuit Scholastic,
after his course of Philosophy, takes his place in a
college to teach Grammar or Literature. If it be
asked, why should this be an almost universal rule,
several reasons are at hand. In the first place, the
candidate for admission into the Order has been accepted
with special reference to this work. If this
reference was expressly overlooked, the candidate so
admitted is in an exceptional category. In the second
place, the whole tenor of what has to be said in
the present chapter will show the pedagogical policy
in the arrangement. But, in the third place, not to
pass over too summarily one special fitness, I will say
a few words upon it at once.</p>

<p>The manner of teaching the young is oral and tutorial.
All through the Jesuit System the manner followed
is oral: in the examinations of the lower classes,
where writing is admitted, it is only as a specimen
of style and composition that writing enters the
examination exercises. With the younger students,
the manner of teaching is oral in its most specific
sense. It is not that generic quality which will suit
as well the lecturer or the public speaker. But it is
the tutorial manner, which includes a fund of sympathy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
of that tact which supposes sympathy, of such
a superiority, both moral and intellectual, as knows
how to stoop, and elevate the boy by stooping, and
does it all naturally, instinctively, gracefully. In the
ordinary course of human affairs, this magnetic power
of the teacher is more intense, according as in years
he is nearer to the subject on whom his ascendancy
plays, and by whom it is spontaneously admitted. I
mean that inestimable and precious subject, the mind
and heart of the impressionable boy, who is about to
develop into manhood, first young, and then mature.</p>

<p>The youthful subject is rich, though not in positive
acquisitions already made its own; for, in this
respect, it may rather be considered <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">parum fructuosa</i>,
as Sacchini says; that is, bearing little fruit as yet,
either of judgment or positive acquirements. But it
is rich in its promise, as it struggles upward into the
sunshine of varied and beautiful truth. This is the
fact which imposes upon liberal education the duty of
omitting nothing that is either beautiful or polished,
in imagination, thought, or style. It justifies Belles
Lettres and the most finished course of Literature, as
being the chosen garden of flowers and fruit, to entertain
withal, richly and exquisitely, the youthful promise
of mind, sentiment, and heart.</p>

<p>Or, inverting the figure, if we liken the mind itself
in youth to the choice and prolific soil of a garden,
we may note that, to till such soil, there is need of a
gardener who has a delicate hand and a light touch.
He must not be a lecturer who stands off, nor a speaker
who declaims, nor a text-book monger who reads, and
hears recitations of what a book says; nor is he to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
dole out methods and analyses to an inquisitive sense
and emotional fancy, which, in the youthful soul,
are the temporary vesture of an unfolding intellect;
even, as in nature around, things tangible and palpable
are bursting, to the boy's inquisitive eyes, with
the great intellectual truths which they contain.
Analyses, text-books, lectures are not the powers with
the young mind. But, often enough, we see where
the real power lies; when young men, scarcely as yet
approaching the prime of life, exercise over impressionable
and brilliant youths, not much beneath themselves
in age, such a personal influence as bids fair
to rank them among the greater forces of human
nature&mdash;forces which are great in leading, because
they know so well how to follow. That other form of
ascendancy, more purely intellectual, and originating
in wide learning and maturity of scholarship, belongs
to the University Professor of a later stage of life.
Hence it appears that youthfulness in the Master is
an advantage for the tutorial teaching of the young.</p>

<p>The critics who drew up the preliminary <i>Ratio</i> in
1586 were of opinion that the Masters in the literary
courses should be assigned to their work, not
after their course of Philosophy, but <span class="locked">before.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span> They
would except from this arrangement only the Professor
of Rhetoric; perhaps, also, in the chief colleges,
the Professor of Humanity or Poetry; besides, of
course, those "whose age or deportment shows that
they are too young to become Masters as yet, or too
far advanced in years to be kept back from their Philosophy."
In support of this view, they urge several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
reasons, which do not much concern us here; as, for
instance, that, if young men have once tasted of the
subtleties of the philosophers, they can hardly bring
themselves to take pleasure any more in the insipid
subject-matter of Grammar; they will pore over philosophical
lore; they will branch off, during class, into
philosophical digressions, which may serve for show,
but not for utility. The critics also express a fear
that these philosophers will bring into the school-room
a style of language infected with philosophical
terms; and they quote the eminent Jesuit, Annibal
Codret, to the effect that, if Philosophy has been
tasted beforehand, nothing brilliant in literary style
can subsequently be guaranteed. But, these arguments
notwithstanding, the Society, when it came to
sanction a final arrangement, in the legislative document
of 1599, seems to have entertained a higher
idea of the younger members, and of their ability
and resolution to shake off any deleterious effects of
scholastic Latin, when they advanced to the chair of
purest Latinity. Hence the legislation ordains that
Philosophy is to be studied before undertaking to
teach <span class="locked">Letters.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span></p>

<p>There are several reasons, however, which, as urged
by these critics, are quite relevant to our present
topic. They urge that Grammar studies require a
certain fervor, or alacrity, which is rather to be found
in persons who are younger, and so far are nearer to
the thoughts and sentiments of boyhood. The fuller
results of education, in this respect, are not to be had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
from them when older. If authority or experience
is felt to be wanting, it can readily be supplemented
by the Prefect of Studies, who is constantly in attendance
on the classes of Grammar; and his direction
finds a sufficient response in the teacher's aptitude and
docility. Indeed, docility to counsel is so indispensable
a requisite, on the part of young teachers, that
the General Mutius Vitelleschi observes: "If they
were to show themselves impatient of correction, and
were to refuse the necessary aids for becoming efficient,
they should on all accounts be removed from
teaching, even if they had filled only half a year;
since it is more just and expedient that one suffer
shame, than that many be <span class="locked">injured."<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span></p>

<p>Unless singular talents, or the bare force of circumstance,
recommend another course of action, it
is not desirable that new teachers should at once
become Masters of the higher class of Grammar or
of Humanity, though otherwise not unfit for these
grades. On all accounts, say the critics, the rule
should be that they start with the lowest classes, and
then, year after year, advance to the next higher
grade, with the best part of their scholars. A certain
crudeness and inexperience which, at the beginning,
are unavoidable in their management, will cause, as
long as it lasts, not so much evil with the younger as
with the older students. Inexperience wears away
with practice. Then again, if the Masters go up
each year, and the scholars go with them, the same
students are very much with the same teachers.
The young people have not to pass so often from one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
kind of management to another. Frequent change
entails a waste of time, until each party comes to
know the other, and understand his own as well as
the other's <span class="locked">part.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span> In 1583, Father Oliver Manare,
visiting the German Provinces by the General's authority,
had noticed this point, in his ordinance for
the management of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictus</i>, or boarding colleges;
that "frequent changes were burdensome to the students
themselves, because they were forced to accommodate
themselves often to new teachers or <span class="locked">prefects."<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span></p>

<p>In the same sense, these critics, whom we are following,
consider it undesirable that a Master should
resign his post in less than three years. Frequent
and manifold changes provoke complaints on the part
of the outside world. Besides, the Master's own
efforts at acquiring perfection in the magisterial art
will be cut short. When there is no prospective permanency
in a position, the mind is not so seriously
applied to the work in <span class="locked">hand.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span></p>

<p>In all this, a most important question regarding
boys is being faced by these critics; and a definite
practical solution is adopted. The question is, which
of the two alternatives to adopt, whether to submit
boys to one person's dominant influence, or to
pass them on through the hands of divers experienced
and permanent Professors, stationed respectively in
the different grades. This latter alternative, if it is
understood to mean that one Professor remains perpetually
in one grade, and another in another, scarcely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
seems to merit consideration with them, except as regards
the two highest literary classes,&mdash;of Poetry and
Rhetoric,&mdash;where the requirements of erudition are
so considerable as to need a lengthened term of years
for filling the chairs worthily. But, if the alternative
regarding permanent Professors means that the same
teachers remain constantly within the limits of the
same curriculum, then the question seems to be the
one which the critics of the preliminary <i>Ratio</i> argue
about in both senses, for and against; and they finally
arrive at a solution, or rather a <span class="locked">compromise.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span></p>

<p>The severest thing they say against the plan is in
this wise, when speaking directly of the two highest
grades: "Perpetuity of that kind may give occasion to
mere idleness and indifference; for after acquiring, in
the first years, some esteem and name for their learning
(in Poetry or Rhetoric), Masters prefer to enjoy the
fruit and name of the labor already undergone, however
moderate that was, rather than wear themselves
out with new labors. Hence they make no new acquisitions
in the learning and accomplishments proper
to their branch; they get rooted in very much the
same spot, and teach what they have taught before
over and over again, though with some variations.
What is worse, as if they were quite worn out with
their prolonged exertions, they say that they cannot
any longer stand all the labor of exercising their students;
whence everything freezes, and they ask for
an assistant, who, if he is unlearned, does more harm
than good; if learned, then why are two doing the
work of one?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
The solution which they arrive at is a compromise,
which recognizes peculiar advantages in both arrangements.
It is embodied in several rules of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio
Studiorum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> As many perpetual Professors as possible,
for Grammar and Rhetoric, are to be provided;
and some candidates for admission to the Order, who
seem qualified for this field of work, though apparently
not likely to succeed in the higher studies of the Society,
may be admitted on this condition, that they
devote themselves in perpetuity to this work of zeal.
Thus such exigencies are provided for as postulate a
perpetuity of professorship within the same limited
curriculum.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the normal process is that which
arranges a constant succession of teachers in the college,
but not a constant change with the same boys.
The same boys go hand in hand with the one Master,
with whom they have most to do. And no one is to
take charge of them, however transiently, says the
General Vitelleschi, "whether on account of fewness
of numbers, or merely to supply for another in his
absence, of whom it is not certain that he is qualified
for the <span class="locked">post."<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span> The very frequent mention, in all
these discussions, of something like domestic tragedies
resulting from the change of masters, seems to
show two things; first, it justifies the practice of
keeping the same Professor over the same boys for a
certain term of years, if not until the class itself dissolves
into higher courses; secondly, it shows what a
usual condition it was for masters to have won the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
most absolute attachment to themselves, in the exercise
of their magisterial duties, both on the side of
parents and on the part of the scholars. Thus, speaking
of the Professors mounting with their classes, the
critics say: "They will have observed what their disciples
need; they will take them up to the next class.
And hence, that changing of Masters, which has caused
so many tragic scenes, will not be felt so <span class="locked">much."<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span></p>

<p>Add to these elements of permanency and identity,
another which is most fundamental of all, the identity
of their formation as Masters; so that the young
Jesuits, as the General Visconti sums up the matter
in 1752, "must have the most accomplished Professors
of Rhetoric, immediately after their novitiate,
men who not only are altogether eminent in this faculty,
but who know how to teach, and make everything
smooth for them; men of eminent talent and the
widest experience in the art; who are not merely to
form good scholars, but to train good Masters"; and
that "two years entire must be given to Rhetoric, according
to the custom of the Society, which term is
not to be abridged, unless necessity is <span class="locked">urgent."<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></span> Add,
moreover, the uniformity of plan, "so that the form of
our schools may be everywhere as much as possible
the same, and, when Masters are changed, itself need
undergo no <span class="locked">change."<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span> It follows that, though the
flow of new blood is constantly entering the pedagogic
body, and a constant renewal is taking place, neither
the permanency nor the identity of the teaching body
and its system is found to depend upon the same individuals
remaining at the same posts. Naturally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
such conditions are not to be looked for, except in the
special circumstances of a religious community, with
perfect organization in the body, with the conscientiousness
of a self-denying formation actuating the
members, with the landmarks of traditions, and a
statutory method to show the way; and, finally, with
executive officials adequate to control.</p>

<p>As to this last-named condition of executive superintendence
over persons and things in the system,
several rules for the Prefect of Studies of these literary
courses will explain themselves. The <i>Ratio</i> of
1599 says: "Let him have the rules of the Masters
and scholars, and see that they are observed, as if
they were his own. Let him help the Masters themselves
and direct them, and be especially cautious
that the esteem and authority due to them be not in
the least impaired. Let him be very solicitous that
the new Preceptors follow with accuracy the manner
of teaching, and other customs of their predecessors,
provided that these were not foreign to our method;
so that persons outside may not have reason to find
fault with the frequent change of Masters. Once a
fortnight, at least, let him listen to each one <span class="locked">teaching."<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span></p>

<p>This moral identity being secured, in the ways,
means, and views of the teaching body, the individual
and personal elements, which each Master brings to
bear upon the work before him, are no more interfered
with, or hampered by community of method, than
are all the varieties of race, nation, politics, and environment,
slighted or interfered with by a single<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
system of collegiate institution being placed in their
midst. It was in view of being everywhere, that the
system was cast in its precise and adjustable form, so
that, in spite of being everywhere, it should be found
equally manageable and effective. And similarly, in
spite of the system itself being one, the play of individual
talents can be various, as are the movable factors
in any great organization.</p>

<p>We may close this chapter by observing several
far-reaching consequences of the foregoing principles.
In the first place, those who, after personal experience
in the classes, come to take charge of colleges in the
capacity of Rectors, are found, say the critics of 1586,
to take full and accurate account of studies and Professors
alike; for they themselves "have borne the burden
of the schools, and know how to sympathize with
others from their own experience"; a fact which is
the more conducive to the end in view, as "colleges
have been instituted for the study of letters. Besides,
not unfrequently there arise in the classes, especially
of the smaller colleges, difficulties which can
scarcely be overcome, except by a Rector who has
personal experience to guide him; otherwise, whether
he chances to solve the difficulty aright, or solves it
awry, he will not do much good either way, since they
do not give him the credit of knowing <span class="locked">how."<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span> The
"smaller colleges" spoken of here, as more liable to
encounter internal difficulties, are contrasted elsewhere
by these critics with "the greater and principal
ones, in which there are many counsellors or referees
at hand, to whom the Masters can have recourse for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
assistance; and the schools themselves have sufficient
authority." But, in what they call the minor colleges,
"the authority of the schools depends for the most part
on the reputation and authority of the individual Masters,"
who happen at a given time to be filling the <span class="locked">posts.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span></p>

<p>In the spirit of this personal and experienced concurrence
with all the affairs of the college, the Rector
is required so to moderate the other concerns of his
office, as to be prompt in fostering and advancing all
literary exercises. He is to go often to the classes,
those of the lower faculties as well as of the <span class="locked">higher.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span>
Every month, or at least every other month, he is to
hold general consultations with all the Masters below
the course of Logic, the several Prefects being
present; and, after the reading of some selection from
the <i>Ratio</i>, concerning the Masters or the piety and
good conduct of the students, he is to inquire what
difficulties occur, or what omissions are noticed in the
observance of <span class="locked">rules.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span> Books are never to be wanting,
in the sufficiency desired by the members generally,
whether they are engaged in teaching, or are pursuing
their <span class="locked">studies.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span> To this regulation, which concerns the
chief authority in a Province, the revised <i>Ratio</i> of
1832 adds: "The same is to be said of literary periodicals
for the use of the Professors; of museums,
physical apparatus, and other equipments, which are
needed by a college according to its degree." The
General Visconti observes somewhat emphatically,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
that "in buying books the Rectors will never consider
the money of their colleges ill <span class="locked">spent."<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span></p>

<p>Jouvancy applies the same principle to publishing
the literary productions of the Masters. He first
sketches the series of literary productions expected
from them,&mdash;the annual addresses of inauguration to
be given by each Professor in his own class, the public
and solemn one to be delivered, on the same inaugural
occasion, by the Professor of Rhetoric, the poem to be
composed and read by the Master of Poetry; then,
during the year, a certain number of addresses to be
delivered; and, at the end, a tragedy composed by the
Professor of Rhetoric, a minor drama by the Professor
of Poetry, both to be acted on the stage. Jouvancy
goes on to recommend that no public occasion be
allowed to go by, without receiving the tribute of
some such literary work. Then he adds: "Nor is that
expense to be considered useless which is incurred for
printing and publishing good poems. In all these
matter, splendors should be added to literary exercises,
and to the exhibition thereof, in such wise that everything
meanwhile tends to solidity of <span class="locked">erudition."<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span></p>

<p>A second consequence of the literary cast, marking
the whole Order, is the vantage-ground on which it
placed the Jesuits, with regard to all the learning and
the learned men of Europe. The fluent and elegant
command of the Latin language gave at once a mastery
over the vehicle of intercourse, in which all learning
was conveyed. Our critics of 1586 sum up the
bearings of this particular advantage under several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
heads: The members of the Order deal with so
many nations; scholastic disputations, whether in
Philosophy or Theology, are always conducted in
Latin; the members write so many books; they can
do justice to the ancient Fathers of the Church;
they have to deal constantly with learned <span class="locked">men.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span></p>

<p>A last consequence, which I shall present, is suggested
by an observation of the same writers, in
the same place. It throws no little light upon the
history of the Society, and it shows the practical adjustment
of the educational system to the times. They
say then, it is by the studies of Belles-Lettres, more
than by the higher faculties, that the Society has, in
a short time, been propagated through all the principal
parts of Christendom. Nor can it be preserved better
or more solidly, than by the same means through
which it was first introduced. Unless they endeavor
to maintain this honorable distinction, with which
God has been pleased to grace the Society, there is
reason to fear that they themselves may yet lapse into
the barbarism, which they are far from admiring in
others. "As to the other faculties, which are brilliant
enough of themselves, there is no trouble in cultivating
them. But, natural inclinations feeling a
repugnance for less conspicuous pursuits, people
have, as it were, to drag themselves to these lower
faculties. They should take lesson, therefore, by good
husbandmen, who bestow more care on transplanted
and exotic growths than on native <span class="locked">shoots."<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span> And
they proceed to quote the rule, formulated in the
words of Ignatius, by the General Everard Mercurian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
who required the institution and preservation of the
literary <span class="locked">seminary.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span> So that we end here this discussion
on the lower faculties, at the point where we
began.</p>

<p>In all well-assorted plans each element has a reference
to every other. Men must match the work, and
the work be suited to the men. Were the men not
formed, the best system would settle into an inert
state; and, the more consistency and vitality of its
own it offered to contribute, the more inept and inert
would it look, a memorial of what it might do, dead
to what it can. In itself, and in its effects, it might
appear to be out of date, as not being understood.
Only the practical working of a thing, by the man
who understands it, shows it off for what it is worth.
This is a rule quite universal, wherever practical insight
is needed for the working of a mechanism. It
must be worked intelligently to be understood. Once
it is understood, the practical intelligence grows.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE COURSES OF DIVINITY AND ALLIED SCIENCES.
PRIVATE STUDY. REPETITION.</span></h2>

<p>1. Having finished his course of teaching literature,
the Jesuit returns to his higher studies. Divinity
and its allied sciences stand out in prominence for
their intrinsic dignity; but they have, besides, a
studied preëminence assigned them in the system
before us. The almost universal rule, of intermitting
the higher studies with a course of literary teaching,
undergoes a special exception in the case of those
"theologians, whose number is few, and use so
<span class="locked">manifold";<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></span> of whom Aquaviva says that, "according
as the higher courses are developed, the fewer
proportionately, out of many students, become qualified
to profess those exalted <span class="locked">sciences."<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span> The same
policy holds with respect to those who have an
eminent talent for oratory. Laynez, himself a great
preacher, and a competent judge in the matter,
relieved Father Francis Strada of the office of Provincial,
to set him free for the ministry of the pulpit;
and he wrote, as he did so: "If only he had a sufficiency
of those whom he could put in the office of
Provincial, he would relieve all preachers of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
office, that they might devote themselves entirely to
spreading the seed of the Divine <span class="locked">Word."<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span> Of these
and others, "who give eminent promise of being equal
to the graver occupations, or for whom an immediate
need exists in that <span class="locked">direction,"<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span> an immediate application
is to be made to the study of <span class="locked">Theology.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span></p>

<p>All who graduate in these higher courses do so, as
"qualified to profess"; just as they had graduated
in Philosophy and its cognate <span class="locked">branches.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span> But, though
a master in the matter of his philosophical triennium,
no student is called upon to profess any of those
branches, until he has graduated also in Theology.
Here we may advert to several lines of strict parallelism
in the system, both with regard to admitting
any students, whether Jesuits or not, to the respective
courses of study, and with regard to admitting Jesuits
themselves to profess in the chairs.</p>

<p>As a condition for admitting any students at all
into the higher courses, the Society introduced a much-needed
reform, in requiring that literary qualifications
of a sufficiently high grade should precede matriculation.
Thus the University of Ingolstadt ordains
that no one shall be admitted to Academic, that is,
University lectures, except after one year of Rhetoric;
and it adds very strict regulations about the election
of courses, repetitions, disputations, etc., in the three
years' curriculum of <span class="locked">Philosophy.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
In like manner, to be admitted as a student of Divinity
and its correlative sciences, it is necessary to
have graduated in the course of Arts, that is to say,
Philosophy and its branches. Thus the University
of Würzburg ordains that no one shall be admitted
as an auditor of Scholastic Theology, unless he be
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Magisterio insignis</i>, "a Master of Arts"; it excepts
only the members of religious Orders in attendance,
and also <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Principis Alumnos</i>, "the Prince's scholars."
Others, who have not so graduated, it will admit to
Moral Theology and its supplementary branches. It
will not even examine, for the Mastership in Arts,
any one, whether a Religious or not, who has studied
Philosophy in a private institution or a <span class="locked">monastery.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span>
To apply for Academic Degrees, "they must prove
that they have followed all the courses in some approved
public <span class="locked">University."<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span></p>

<p>The curriculum, now before the student, is a quadriennium,
or four-year course. It is prolonged into
a fifth and sixth year, for reviewing the whole ground
of one's studies; for preparing a public defence against
all comers; and, in the case of Jesuit students, for
an immediate preparation to fill the Professor's chair,
the pulpit, or to discharge other functions. Hence
the University of Cologne specifies, in general, a sexennium,
or six-year course for <span class="locked">Theology.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Not unlike to this is the parallelism which we may
notice, in appointing the members of the Society to
Professors' chairs. Though qualified to teach literature
after his own complete course of letters in the
seminary, yet, as we have seen, no one is to be put
over the classes of Grammar or Humanity who has
not first studied his Philosophy. And so again, at
this stage, though apparently competent to teach
Philosophy, and approved as being qualified to profess
it, yet no one is to be put in a chair of that
course who has not also studied his <span class="locked">Theology.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span></p>

<p>The reasons for this are assigned by the critics of
1586. The philosopher, they say, who has not yet
become a theologian, will not be so safe in his conclusions,
in his proofs, in his manner of expression.
He will be of an age less mature. His learning will
be less superabundant. He will scarcely be able to
answer the arguments of unbelievers. Nor will he
treat Philosophy in a way to render it useful to
Theology. In fine, the proprieties of things cannot
be well observed, if he who has just filled a chair of
Philosophy has to sit down as a mere student in <span class="locked">Theology.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span></p>

<p>The branches of this theological course are Scholastic
Theology, Moral Theology, Sacred Scripture, Hebrew
and Oriental Languages, Ecclesiastical History,
and Canon Law. The general category of students
is naturally more limited than in the philosophical
curriculum. There the auditors were young men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
who would betake themselves, at its close, to Medicine,
or other walks of life. They may have taken to
Law; though Possevino, himself eminent in jurisprudence,
would seem to imply that Canon Law must
have been pursued <span class="locked">first.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span> The students now are chiefly
Ecclesiastics, with various careers before them; or they
are Religious of different Orders; or, finally, the
members of the Society itself. The principal object
of our consideration is the formation of these latter,
as qualified to profess. The pedagogical elements
before us may be ranged under three heads: Private
Study; Repetition, which includes Disputation; Lecturing,
which is supplemented by Dictation.</p>

<p>2. As to the method of private study, all the
auditors of the course are directed to look over, prior
to the <span class="locked">lecture,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span> the text in Aristotle, St. Thomas,
etc., which the Professor is about to <span class="locked">explain.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span> Then,
while the lecture is being delivered, they take down
notes; the copying of mere dictation is not favored.
After the lecture, they are to read over the notes which
they have taken down. Let them endeavor to understand
their annotations. Understanding what they
have written, they are to make objections to themselves
against the thesis established, and endeavor to
solve their own objections. If they cannot find a solution,
let them note the difficulties, and take occasion to
ask the Professor, or reserve them for disputation.
Such is the method of private study prescribed for the
members of the <span class="locked">Order,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></span> and laid down in more general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
terms for the other <span class="locked">students.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></span> To develop habits of
such study, and to afford the requisite leisure, a certain
custom, then prevailing in Portugal, of keeping
the Professors of Philosophy and their students during
two hours and a half consecutively in the lecture
room is discountenanced by the critics of 1586: "That
the philosophers should remain two whole hours and
a half in class, as is now done, is burdensome to the
Professor and troublesome to the students; for these
latter should get accustomed to private study, lest,
like parrots, they seem to be always talking by <span class="locked">rote."<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span></p>

<p>This curtailing of class hours was characteristic of
the Society's system. In 1567 the General Father
Francis Borgia wrote, through his secretary Polanco,
correcting, in this respect, a school-regulation which
had been followed in the lower classes of the German
Province. The secretary writes: "It is found by experience,
in the schools of the Company, that to teach
three consecutive hours in the forenoon, and three
more in the afternoon, is injurious to the health of
our Masters, and does no good to the health of the
scholars; for which reason it is now ordained that in
our schools the morning classes shall not last longer
than two and a half hours, and the same in the <span class="locked">afternoon."<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing intensifies more the results of studies than
concentration, nor dissipates them more than division
of attention, while a given pursuit is in progress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
This principle applies to the number of courses taken
up at one time, the conduct of private studies in any
single course, and the degree to which the appointed
teachers and the standard authors have full justice
done them. On this head, the critics of 1586 give
recommendations, derived from the Constitution, for
the direction of all the students in general, and for
the members of the Order in particular. The recommendations
are embodied briefly in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>
With Aristotle in Philosophy, or with St.
Thomas in Theology, one commentary is to be designated,
and that a specially chosen author, suited to
the individual's capacity. In the second year of
Theology, one of the Fathers of the Church can be
added, "to be read at odds and ends of time, or after
the fatigue of a long stretch of study. Another can
be substituted, if after a while they ask for another.
But care should be taken that they do not spend too
much time on this reading, as if they were getting up
a <span class="locked">sermon."<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></span></p>

<p>All this, no doubt, tends to make the student "a
man of one book," who, as the adage says, is much to
be feared. However, when he goes through every
course, and is everywhere a man of concentrated attention,
while, for the purpose of public disputation
and the attempted refutation of his own and the
Professor's conclusions, the side avenues of various
authors and systems are studiously and necessarily
kept open, it is probable that, after being "a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
one book," in many courses successively, he will also
be well-rounded by the time his formation is complete.
With students in general, this can be accomplished
by the age of twenty-five; with the Jesuits
themselves, about the age of thirty-three.</p>

<p>3. I come now to the subject of Repetition, of
which two chief forms offer themselves. One is just
what the word of itself indicates; it belongs to all the
faculties, but chiefly to the lower courses. I shall
call it by the generic name of Repetition. The other
has place principally in the higher; it is Disputation;
of which a preparatory exercise, called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Concertatio</i>,
prevails also from the lowest class of Grammar upwards.</p>

<p>Repetition then rehearses in full class, under various
forms or modifications of that exercise, what the Professor
has explained in class. Just before the close
of the hour spent on his lecture, the Professor of
Philosophy or Theology signifies that he is ready for
questions on the matter treated; he asks sometimes
an account of the lecture, and he sees that it is repeated.
The revised <i>Ratio</i> of 1832 puts it, in more
general terms, thus: "He is often to require an account
of the lectures, and to see that they are repeated";
and then it desires that, after the lecture,
either in the class-room, or somewhere near, he remain
accessible to the students for at least a quarter
of an hour, to answer their <span class="locked">questions.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span> This is all
from the Constitution of Ignatius.</p>

<p>The Repetition, which he is to see to personally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
is that which takes place in small circles of about
ten students each. "At the close of the lectures let
them, in parties of about ten apiece, repeat for half
an hour what they have just heard; one of the students,
and, if possible, a member of the Society,
presiding over each party, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">decuria</i>."<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> Neither the
preliminary, nor the final, <i>Ratio</i> demands that the Professor
himself preside over any of these parties. But
"those who do preside will become more learned, and
will be practising to become Masters <span class="locked">themselves."<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></span></p>

<p>It must be admitted that the tenor of many remarks
in the earlier document of 1586, shows the
presence of Jesuits among the auditors to have acted
on the course as a leaven and a relief; although the
concurrent testimony of historians, about the Jesuit
schools, indicates little or nothing there of that license
of manners, such as Possevino described for us in a
former <span class="locked">chapter.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></span> In a special manner, those Jesuit
students, already young priests, who, having gone
through their four-year course, were now reviewing
in a biennium, of a fifth and sixth year, all their long
studies of the higher sciences, stood ready at hand for
many functions in the arena of direction and presidency,
either over the repetitions or the disputations,
or in the chair; to which as many of them as were
needed would be officially assigned, when their private
studies left them at last <span class="locked">free.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
To say a word upon this class of Jesuit students,
they show us the Professor's formation at its last
stage. They are reviewing all Theology, Philosophy,
Sacred Scripture, Canon Law, Polemical or Controversial
Theology, and ecclesiastical erudition generally.
The last of their rules for self-guidance says:
"In particular, they are to devote themselves most
of all to that pursuit, to which they feel chiefly
drawn, without, however, omitting any of the <span class="locked">rest."<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></span>
Meanwhile, they present, in various ways, specimens
of their talent and erudition; they throw into the form
of a digest, "from their own genius," all Theology,
under certain heads and principles; they can choose
some "splendid <span class="locked">subject,"<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></span> and deliver ten public lectures
thereupon to the auditors who choose to attend,
which, we may observe, was precisely the status of
all Professors in the mediæval universities. In their
acts of public defence, five of which are prescribed
during the two years, they are free to follow or to
leave the opinions of their late <span class="locked">Professors.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></span></p>

<p>These students then are assistant and extraordinary
Professors. They have begun the work, which some
of them will continue when called upon to become
Professors in ordinary. They are already in training
for that independent work, which the revised
<i>Ratio</i> of 1832 shows some anxiety about preserving;
for it says to all who occupy any chair in these faculties,
that, in case they adopt a standard author to
follow in their lectures, which is a custom rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
prevalent in more recent times, they must nevertheless
deliver each year some special question elaborated
independently by <span class="locked">themselves.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></span> This independence of
style, perfect command of the matter, with express
leave for the incipient Professor, in the course of his
final biennium, to relinquish the opinions of his late
Professors, are made the subject of many a remark by
the critics of 1586. Withal, it is clear enough that
for a younger man to leave an approved opinion
safely, it is very necessary for him to know well what
he is about; and doubly necessary when he comes
forward in a public defence; for his own late Professors
are among the Doctors present, and are there
to assail him in all his tenets.</p>

<p>These, then, or others presiding over the circles,
"one person repeats, the others listening; they propose
difficulties mutually, and, if they cannot solve
their own objections, they consult the <span class="locked">Professor."<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></span>
The one who repeats is to do so, not from his notes,
but from memory. Thus "the memory is exercised;
practice is afforded those who are to be Masters, so
that they accustom themselves to develop their
thoughts before others; it makes them all keep alive
and attentive during the lecture, to take down the
necessary notes, as they might not do, if they were
free from such <span class="locked">repetition."<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span> There are several other
possible forms of conducting this exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
When once the first crude repetition is over, the
series of disputations begins, daily, weekly, monthly,
yearly. Without counting in the "Grand Acts" of public
defence against all objectors, at stated times and by
specially designated persons, we may enumerate as
many as seven ordinary rehearsals of the same matter.</p>

<p>First, before going to the lecture hall, the student
looks over the text. This is done easily enough in
St. Thomas or Aristotle, if one of these is the standard.
As Ignatius expected would be done, many
standard works have been published by writers of the
<span class="locked">Society.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></span> Their recommendation is, as he intimated,
that they are "more adapted to our times"; and they
have incorporated recent researches in progressive
branches. In the sense of this adaptation to times
and circumstances, the theologians in Cologne, making
their announcement for the year 1578, say that they
follow St. Thomas as a general rule, but not so "as to
treat all that he treats, nor only what he treats....
Every age," they say, "has its own debated ground
in matters of doctrine, and this brings it to pass that
Theology is not only constantly enlarged with a
variety of new disputations, but assumes, as it were, a
new <span class="locked">cast."<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></span> And the critics of the preliminary <i>Ratio</i>,
treating of the Scripture course, lecture at some length
all whom it may concern,&mdash;theologians, professors,
preachers,&mdash;precisely on this ground, the need of
amplifying and adapting the course of Scripture to
the conditions of the <span class="locked">times.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></span> Accordingly, works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
always new and adapted to latest needs, have poured
forth from the writers of the Order. And such as
furnish the conditions of a text, which may readily
be followed, also supply the conditions for conning
over, before going to the lecture hall, what the Professor
means to treat. If no such standard is being
followed, still, as I find noted in a documentary
report of 1886, "the Professors should always, as far
as possible, throw out directions enough for the students
to look up the subject before coming to the lecture."</p>

<p>In this connection many familiar names of authors
occur. For Scholastic Theology and Philosophy,
there is, in the first place, the prince of modern theologians,
Francis Suarez, with his library of tomes;
there are the three Cardinals Toletus, Bellarmine, De
Lugo; Valentia, Vasquez, Lessius, Franzelin; and,
in the modern school of Scholastic Philosophy, the
elegant Liberatore, Kleutgen, Tongiorgi, Pesch, along
with the writers of Louvain, Stonyhurst, Innsbruck,
and elsewhere; in Positive Theology and Controversy,
Canisius, Becanus, Petau, Sardagna; in Exegesis,
Maldonado, Salmeron, À Lapide, Menochius, Patrizi,
Cornely, with the school of Maria Laach; in Moral
Theology, an endless number, Sanchez, Laymann,
Busembaum, with his two hundred editions, Gury,
<span class="locked">Ballerini.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, the student hears the Professor's lecture.
Thirdly, one of the forms of regular repetition is
gone through. Fourthly, the daily disputation takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
place, at least among the Jesuit Scholastics: "At
home, every day except on Saturdays, free and feast
days, one hour is to be appointed," during which,
after a preliminary summarizing of the matter for
defence, the disputation follows; and, if time remains
over, difficulties may be proposed. "In order to have
some time remain over, the president must have the
syllogistic form of discussion rigidly observed; and,
if nothing new is being urged, he will cut off the
<span class="locked">debate."<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></span></p>

<p>Fifthly, there is the weekly disputation: "On
Saturday, or some other day, as the custom of the
University has it, let them hold disputations in the
schools during two hours, or longer still, whenever
there is a large concourse of persons who come to
<span class="locked">hear."<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></span> Sixthly, the more solemn disputation follows,
every month, or nearly so: "Each month, or,
if the students are few, every other month, let disputations
be held on a certain day, both morning and
afternoon. The number of defendants will correspond
to the number of Professors whose theses they <span class="locked">defend."<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></span>
Seventhly, towards the close of the scholastic
year, though no time is to be set aside for the purpose,
so as to prejudice the continuous course of the Professor's
lectures, yet "all the matter of the year is to
have been gone through, by way of repetition, when
the time of vacation <span class="locked">arrives."<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></span> The whole of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
matter forms the subject of the year's examination for
the Jesuit members of the <span class="locked">course.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></span> To all these argumentative
repetitions may be added the discursive
form, in the shape of lectures given by the students
themselves, or dissertations read on stated <span class="locked">occasions.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></span></p>

<p>It is evident that the members of the Society are
the chief subjects of this completeness of formation;
and that for two reasons. In the first place, no other
students, even if <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictores</i>, that is, boarders in the
Jesuit colleges, can be brought under such a thoroughness
of system. Secondly, other students are not in
the same way subject to the regular gradation of examinations
from year to year. When they are competent,
they may apply for admission to the requisite
public tests, or Acts of Defence; and, in the philosophical
courses, they become Bachelors, Licentiates, and
Masters of Arts; in Theology, Bachelors in the first
and then in the second grade, Licentiates, Doctors.
"No degree is to be conferred on any one who has
not stood all the tests, which, according to the custom
of Universities, must precede the conferring of these
degrees." The character of each degree, its conditions,
tests, formalities, are treated of fully in the
"Form and Method of conducting Academies and <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Studia
Generalia S.&nbsp;J.</i>," <span class="locked">1658.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></span></p>

<p>Here, then, the spirit of the Constitution is fully
observed, with regard to repetition and also disputation.
The Fathers remark that Ignatius "recommends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
nothing with more urgency than disputation,
and constancy in its exercise; so much stress does he
lay upon it, as not to let the students of Letters and
Grammar go without <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></span> In the lower classes it
takes the form of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">concertatio</i> and mutual challenges, in
the matter of Grammar and literary doctrine. Here
it is in its full form; and we may pass on to consider
it in the next chapter, not as a manner of repetition,
but on its own merits.</p>

<p>I will make the transition, by quoting an important
passage or two from the preliminary <i>Ratio</i>. They
bear not only on disputation, but on that very essential
point, where it is that the vital power for actuating
the whole system lies; and what is the intrinsic
value of any system, as a mere code of legislation.</p>

<p>The critics say that, to counteract the apparent
decline of disputation, and to restore this exercise
to its ancient form and splendor, everything depends
on the vigilance and diligence of those in authority.
"Without this, nothing will be effected, even though,
for the proper administration of this department of
studies, many laws and precepts are put down in
<span class="locked">writing."<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></span> Elsewhere, acknowledging in another
connection that there is indeed a multitude of points
defined for observance, the same writers go on to make
these pertinent reflections: "The perfection of doctrine,
like the perfection of moral life, stands in need
of many aids; whence it is that there is no people
under the direction of more laws than the Christian
people, nor any Religious Order more under the obligation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
of Constitution and Decrees than our own."
They undertake to prove the advantage of this, both
from the side of those in authority, and of those
under authority. "Aristotle and St. Thomas," they
say, "are both of opinion that as few points as
possible should be left to the private opinions of a
judge, and as many as possible should be determined
by the clear definition of law. They prove it; for
it is easier to find the few wise men, whose wisdom
is equal to the task of determining fixed rules of
guidance, than to find the multitude, which otherwise
is required to pass judgment in all contingencies
of time and place; there is the sanction of
greater maturity in laws which have stood the test
of time and experience, than in the off-hand decision
of the present hour; there is less of a corrupting influence
on law-givers, when they are defining things
in general and for the future. Wherefore, whatever
can be despatched by general law is so to be despatched;
what cannot be provided for by such law is to be left
to the judge, as the living rule. Under this head
come the particular decisions to be passed in given
junctures, whereof the general law cannot take cognizance."
So far Aristotle and St. Thomas; and the
Fathers of 1586 agree with <span class="locked">them.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead">DISPUTATION. DICTATION.</span></h2>

<p>1. Many wise things had been said by the experienced
masters of old on the subject of disputation.
Thus Robert of Sorbon, the founder of the College of
the Sorbonne, had put it down in one of his six essential
rules for the scholar, that "nothing is perfectly
known unless masticated by the tooth of <span class="locked">disputation."<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></span></p>

<p>Our Jesuit critics mention incidentally, in one
place, that "their age is eminently versed in <span class="locked">disputation."<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></span>
They are cautioning the Professor of Scripture
against using disputation at all, lest he come
thereby to relinquish his own eloquent style of commentary.
For every chair has its own character; and
that which the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i> of 1599 attributes to
the chair of Scripture includes, among a number of
qualifications, this one, which is mentioned in the
last place, that, "as far as possible, the Professors be
well versed in <span class="locked">eloquence."<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
On the other hand, in the proper arena of disputation,
they caution Professors against its abuse. Taking
note, in one place, of the discord which can arise
among learned men, they illustrate their point with
some instances, taken precisely from a disputatious
tendency, from that exaggerated scholasticism which
had run into dialectic excesses. They say: "For the
disturbance of harmony, it makes very little difference
whether discord arises in great things or in little.
It is not only the importance of a question, it is also
the spirit of emulation, that fosters contention; so that
sometimes a war of words and the bitterest altercation
is kept up on a single term and phrase. Forsooth,
what is more trivial than to ask whether God is in
imaginary space? Yet what tragic scenes does not
this very question give rise to!"<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<p>Excesses of this kind being guarded against, the
Fathers lay down the thesis that, when employed in
its proper place, no exercise is more useful than disputation.
You will see not a few wholly taken up
with reading, writing, arranging, and paging what
they have written; but they eschew most carefully all
disputation, neglecting it, looking upon it as an idle
occupation, having all their Theology locked up, not
so much in their memory and intelligence, as in their
paper books. Men of authority, they go on to say,
have always been persuaded that Philosophy and
Theology are learnt, not so much by hearing, as by
discussing. For, in this exercise, you have a most
certain test how much a man understands of what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
is writing about or teaching; also how much solidity
there is in one's own private cogitations, since it
happens not unfrequently that what appears brilliant
in one's private room is seen to drag in the mud,
when it comes to <span class="locked">disputation.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></span> Then, too, while we
are hard pressed by our adversary, we are forced to
strain every nerve of our wits, and, when others are
bearing down heavily upon us, we knock out of our
brains many things which would never have come
into our heads, while we stayed in the quiet of leisure
and rested in the shade. We hear things which others
have found out, and which either throw light on
doubtful points, or indicate the path to some other
point. Or, if what is said does not commend itself
to our judgment, we see through the opponent's artifice;
we meet him with more facility, and establish
our own thesis with more stability. The auditors,
meanwhile, can take note of the good points one Professor
makes, the strong points of another, and, after
the example of their Doctors, they quicken their wits
for the fray, observing where the arguments limp,
which are the distinctions that tell, how the whole
doctrine of a Professor hangs together. In short, it
is well established by the authority of the gravest
men, and by the test of experience, that one disputation
does more good than many lectures; not to mention
the other consideration, that there is nothing
more calculated to render our schools illustrious, than
making our students competent to win great approbation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
and applause, in public sessions and <span class="locked">disputations.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></span></p>

<p>These critics express their mind upon the need
which exists, of reviving considerably the fervor and
dignity of this exercise, and so restoring it to its
former educational influence. But we can observe for
ourselves, how congenial an element the whole exercise
must be in a system like this, which is preëminently
oral&mdash;oral examinations, oral and self-reliant defence
and attack, free and open lecturing, with the influence
of eye, voice, and person, to bring everything home,
even though all the while there is no question of
oratory, but of mere teaching. In the earlier stages,
too, of the scholar's life, however much has been made
of the acquirement of style, "forging the word with
Grammar," as Robert of Sorbon had said, "and polishing
it with Rhetoric," to make it glow on the written
page, yet from the very first, also, no less account has
been taken of the ability to express one's thought,
with perfect presence of mind, without depending upon
note or book. In the higher faculties, this holds good
more than ever. Now the time has come for matter
of the most approved kind. And the independent,
self-possessed delivery of one's thoughts, with the
power to force them home unto conviction, or to
maintain them against all odds, appears not only as
the scope proposed in the system, but also as the historical
result, effected in the public career of the
Order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Father Laynez, at the Conference of Poissy, contended
thus with Peter Martyr and others; Possevino
at Lyons with Viret, using, not so much the severe
syllogistic form, as copious and learned discussion.
Maldonado was double-handed, either syllogistic or
discursive. In the Conference at Sedan, in 1572, he
argued first in dialectic form; then, on the demand
of his opponents for a different kind of weapon, he
took with the same facility to discursive exposition.
Edmund Campian, in England, on being removed
from the rack more dead than alive, was immediately
brought face to face with Newell and Day, able champions
as well of the Queen's spiritual supremacy, as
of the doctrine of Justification by Faith alone. He
proceeded to argue: "If faith alone justifies, it justifies
without charity; but without charity it does not
justify; therefore faith alone does not justify." Now
for the answer, clear and incisive as the propositions.
Deny or distinguish major or minor proposition, if
you want to deny the conclusion; for, those premises
standing, the inference remains intact, since the syllogism
is perfect in form. And so argumentations
proceed.</p>

<p>To revive disputation in its best style, the critics
devote several pages to a most valuable analysis of
the conditions and method of the <span class="locked">exercise.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></span> Their
suggestions are embodied in the final <i>Ratio</i>. The
Rectors are to show their lively and active interest in
the disputations, by attending on public and private
occasions alike, and by the various arts which such
interest will inspire. As argument "freezes except in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
a crowd," the critics require that the attendance of all
be insisted on, when the days and hours of disputation
arrive. This susceptibility of human nature,
which the Fathers touch upon, when they speak of
disputation freezing except in a concourse, is not
without an exact counterpart, when, in another connection,
they are speaking of the humanists, or Professors
of the literary classes. There they adopt the
view that the literary seminary of the Province
should be in the same great college, along with the
faculties of Philosophy and Theology; for, say they,
among other reasons, "the humanists would languish
in obscurity, if they had not the philosophers and
theologians to be witnesses, spectators, and applauding
auditors of their literary achievements." And
again they plead sympathetically, "the philosophers
and theologians, when composing the prefatory essays
for their disputations, call for the taste of the humanists,
by whose verses and orations, moreover, they
are refreshed from time to <span class="locked">time."<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a></span></p>

<p>Continuing their remarks, the Fathers define the
limits of the weekly disputations to be two hours, not
more, assigning four regular objectors for that time.
The Professors, belonging to different faculties, should
invite one another reciprocally to the private disputations
in their classes, at least for an hour or so, that
the intellectual contest may wax warm by the meeting
of these Doctors. Other Doctors, too, not of the
faculty, can be invited for the same purpose. But,
continues the <i>Ratio</i> of 1599, in undertaking to push
the arguments which are being urged, "they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
not take the thread out of the hands of an objector,
who is still ably and strenuously following it <span class="locked">up."<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></span>
Meanwhile, the students who receive the commission
to act as objectors, on occasions of some publicity,
must be the more qualified members of the course;
the others have the practice of their private arena,
until they can take part with dignity in a public
tournament.</p>

<p>If argument freezes except in a crowd, so, too, it
palls, if it never comes to a conclusion; and no useful
point of doctrine is carried away by the listeners.
Truth is lost in clouds, and there is no gain to good
humor. Acrimony or melancholy may well be the
only outcome of an unfinished or revolving argumentation.
It will not revolve, if the disputants
keep to strict syllogistic form. But when both or all
parties become heated, and wit becomes lively, the
syllogism may suffer, and then, when will they
finish? To obviate this inconvenience, two persons
are charged with the responsibility of the performance,
one the Professor himself, who is presiding over
his own disputation, the other, the General Prefect
of Studies, who controls the whole series of disputations,
as they follow one another in turn.</p>

<p>Of the Professor it is said, that he is to consider
the day of disputation as no less laborious and useful
than that of his own lecture; and that all the fruit
and life of the exercise depends upon him. The
earlier <i>Ratio</i> lays even more stress upon the private
disputations, "which are wont to grow more frigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
than the public ones." He is to assist the two disputants,
"so as to be himself apparently the person
contesting in each; let him signify his approval, if
anything specially good is urged, excite the attention
of all when any first-class difficulty is proposed, throw
out a hint now and then to support the respondent or
direct the opponent; call them back to strict syllogistic
form, if they wander from it; not always be silent,
nor yet be always talking, so as to let the students
bring out what they know. What is brought forward,
he can amend or improve; let him bid the objector
proceed, so long as his argument carries weight with
it; carry on the objector's difficulty for him farther;
nor connive at it, if he slips off to another track. He
is not to allow an argument which has been well answered
to be kept up, nor an answer that is not solid
to be long sustained; but, when the dispute has been
sufficiently exhaustive, let him briefly define the matter,
and explain <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></span></p>

<p>The General Prefect of Studies is required to keep
the series of disputations in due form; arguing himself
but sparingly, and thereby discharging the duty
of general direction with more dignity. He is not to
suffer any difficulty which comes under debate, to be
agitated this way and that, "so that it remains as
much of a difficulty after as before"; but when such
an agitated question has been sufficiently mooted, he
will see that an accurate explanation of it is given by
the Professor who is <span class="locked">presiding.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
With the last public act, or general defence of
Philosophy and Theology, the formation of the future
Professor closes. This public defence occupies
four or five hours, in two sessions. If the defendant
is not a member of the Order, special care is taken
to honor it with all solemnity, and with the attendance
of all the faculties, of guests invited, Doctors
from without, and princes or the <span class="locked">nobility.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></span> This
act will be followed by the solemnity of conferring
the final degree upon the Licentiate. When the student
is a Jesuit, much more is made of thoroughness
in a searching examination then, as at all times previously.
He has now passed through a long series of
yearly examinations, which were almost always disputations,
and that, not with equals, but with four or
five <span class="locked">Professors.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></span> So that, on viewing him at the
close of his formation, we are enabled to conceive,
with more distinctness, the meaning of that standard,
"surpassing mediocrity," which, in a former chapter,
I endeavored to <span class="locked">define.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></span></p>

<p>2. On turning our attention now to the Professor's
chair, and examining his manner of lecturing, of explaining,
of teaching, whether in the field of Letters,
Science, Philosophy, or Theology, we have, on the one
side, to suppose him complete in his formation, and,
on the other, to regard the scholar as undergoing
formation. Here, then, we begin the second part of
this analysis. The style of teaching and of management,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
which is distinctively the Jesuit type, is presented
in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i> under its practical
and ideal aspect. There is also a manner of instruction
which is not considered an ideal method, however
much it may sometimes recommend itself as practically
expedient. I will touch upon this latter, the
negative side of the question, first, to be free, in the
next chapter, for approaching the matter on its positive
and constructive side.</p>

<p>In putting dictation down as not being the ideal
form of teaching in the Society, I do not speak of the
proper use of dictation. The <i>Ratio</i> itself leaves room
for it. It is the abuse of dictation that merits and
receives a protracted examination of its value, at the
hands of the critics. The discussion is of the highest
importance. In analyzing a style of instruction, with
which they are not in harmony, they bring out the
essential elements of all true teaching. And, if we
approve at all of their principles, the implied disapproval
for the rejected form becomes only aggravated,
on contemplating an exaggerated development of the
same; that is to say, when, instead of dictating what
has the merit of being one's own laborious production,
the teacher is seen to become the servile dependant
on a text-book printed by somebody else;
and neither does the teacher show any of the qualifications
necessary to have composed the book, nor does
the scholar expend the industry which would have
been necessary to copy it. But it is left to speak as
best it may, is read by the teacher, instead of his
teaching, is read by the scholar as the talk of some
third person, and is found, in the last issue, to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
spoken just articulately enough for the pupil to have
learnt a memory lesson, and perhaps to have gathered
information which may or may not adhere to his
mental structure. But, as to anything like mental
training, or what is properly education, the final result
of a long series of years seems to show that, if
there has been any of it, possibly the man who wrote
the book had it; and with him it has remained. So
must it always be under such conditions. For when
the living Master has contributed so little in the way
of live education, the scholar must, of necessity, go
away with somewhat less.</p>

<p>These critics say trenchantly: "Let no dictation
be given, unless the explanation of very much all
that is dictated has gone before, or accompanies, or
follows the dictation; where the custom does not
exist, let no dictation be introduced; where it does,
an effort should be made to do away with it, as far as
possible." Then they support their position by many
quotations from the Constitution of <span class="locked">Ignatius.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></span></p>

<p>They go on to state that this habit of dictating was
a thing unheard of till within the last forty years;
"yet the auditors were not less learned then than
now." In fact, but a slight acquaintance with the
old university system of Europe will show how jealously
the empire of the spoken word was maintained&mdash;the
spoken word, as distinct, not only from reading
what the Doctor had himself composed, but also from
consulting even notes, while actually lecturing. He
might have the text of Aristotle, or Peter the Lombard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
before him; he might himself have written and
published works; the student might, with permission,
take down notes in shorthand, from which
in part, but chiefly from memory, he would commit
the whole lecture to <span class="locked">writing,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></span> on his return from
school. It was not mere want of facilities that determined
the system so. But the objective point was,
not to have learning in one's papers and bound up;
still less to have it in books, bought for the learning
that is in them, and left afterwards with the learning
still remaining there. The object was to make learning
one's personal possession, and to profess the live
mastery of it, with voice, eye, and person showing
how live it was.</p>

<p>These Doctors continue: "The common impression
in men's minds is, that dictating is not lecturing;
also that it is one thing to write after the manner of
polishing off a treatise, a different thing to have at
hand merely some brief heads and references. And,
should the matter which is dictated be from some
author, the labor of taking it down is superfluous."</p>

<p>The living voice actuates the mind more; it expresses,
it impresses; it arouses, suspends the attention;
it explains. All these effects are nowhere in a
dead-and-alive dictation. Nor do they give satisfaction,
who append the explanation afterwards; for
then both times seem to be lost, that taken up with
dictation and that with the explanation. First,
while the dictation was going on, the auditors were
intent upon writing rather than understanding; particularly
as, before the end of a sentence is come to, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
beginning of it has already slipped from the mind;
and the writing has to go on, without allowing any
of that time to breathe, which is frequent enough if
the Professor lectures and explains. Secondly, when
the time for explanation comes after the dictation, the
students are tired; they think they have all their
learning now, down in their papers; so they go off,
or they yawn, or they read over their copy, to see if
anything is wanting.</p>

<p>After dictating, the Professor thinks that he has
now done his part. What follows, that is, the work
of explaining, he gulps down, as best he can,&mdash;a
laborious work, requiring memory, promptitude,
facility of development, fluency of speech; whence
he will gradually vanish away into a nonentity, as
we see actually taking place in some universities.</p>

<p>More time is lost. For, while he goes over his
dictation to explain it, he has to take up again things
which were clear enough, in order to follow out the
whole thread of his matter. If he had lectured, he
would have said those things once for all. Then,
since it must be something polished and finished in
style that a man dictates, the poor scribes have to
take down much that is not necessary.</p>

<p>As if they had wearied themselves with this general
assault on dictation, the Fathers go on to relieve their
feelings by exclaiming: "What an amount of tedium
meanwhile to those who are not writing, especially to
Prelates and other illustrious persons present! Must
they be told not to come while the dictation is going
on, and to appear only afterwards when the matter is
being explained? If so, they will be in attendance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
barely half an hour, and what they will hear will be
meagre enough; and the person they listen to will be
one accustomed to languid dictation, one who relies
on his papers, and is but little practised in the oral
development of his thoughts. Besides, the students
themselves ought to get accustomed to make things
their own when they hear them, and to exercise their
own judgment in selecting what to write. Thus they
will understand things better, and be kept more on
the alert."</p>

<p>Not to disguise inconveniences, from whatever side
they come, these critics take note of the difficulties
which are thought to exist; that, unless the matter is
dictated, the students cannot do justice to it, that the
lecturer is too quick, or, out of the many things he
says, they do not know how to select the necessary
elements for annotation; and, while phrase is piled
upon phrase, they are at a loss, their notes are disordered,
inept, and sometimes simply wrong.</p>

<p>To this the critics promptly make answer: Those
who are to lecture in future are either such as are
now beginning their career of Professorship, or such
as are long accustomed to dictation. For those who
are now beginning, previous exercise is to be recommended
in the most approved form of lecture, or
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prælectio</i>. And they sketch the form. As to the
others who are long habituated to dictating, the
critics ask such Professors to give this form of lecturing
the benefit of a trial. If they despair of being
able to adopt it, let them go their own way, until
another generation of Professors is ready to take their
places. Dictation can also be permitted, where our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Professors have often tried to give it up, but with the
consequence that the students took fright, and abandoned
the classes. "Yet," continue the Fathers,
"they would not be apt to abandon the courses, nor
complain so much, if all the Professors would devote
themselves to brilliant <span class="locked">lecturing,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></span> and would put away
dictation. For, if one dictates and nurses the lazy
folks, and another does not, who doubts but that
sloth will still be dearer to the slothful than the
labors and thorns of study? Yea, by dictation they
are made daily more and more lazy, so as to be always
asking for more and more time; whereas, without dictation,
they become daily more prompt, and need less
time for <span class="locked">everything."<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></span></p>

<p>The final <i>Ratio</i> of 1599 embodies these suggestions,
without being absolute in excluding all dictation,
for which it suggests the form most useful and
in accord with the spirit of true lecturing. It deprecates
the dictation of what may be found in authors
within reach of the students. "Let the Professor
refer his hearers to those authors who have been copious
and accurate in their treatment of any matter."
As to what the critics of 1586 recommend, that, if
dictation be given, the lecture should extend to five
quarters of an hour, the <i>Ratio</i> says nothing about <span class="locked">it.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></span></p>

<p>Possevino, in his <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Bibliotheca Selecta</i>, has a chapter
on this question, "Whether mental culture suffers by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the dictation of lectures?" He answers in the affirmative,
and he speaks on the subject with his usual
erudition. He refers to the Pythagorean "acoustic"
disciples, who were never copyists, and not even talkers,
until, by a prolonged silence for years, they had
thought enough to be able to talk well, to put questions,
and make comments. He quotes the cynicism
of Diogenes, about writing at the expense of true
exercise. He notes the plan of Xeniades the Corinthian,
who gave a written compendium to the young
people, but one so short that they had to have the
best part of their learning in their heads. The Socratic
method was eminently one of living speech.
And, as to Aristotle's "peripatetic" school, which
was conducted while <i>walking about</i> the Lyceum, that
was certainly neither in practice nor in principle
favorable to writing. Coming to speak expressly of
dictation and citing a pleasant old <span class="locked">rhyme:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quod si charta cadat, secum sapientia <span class="locked">vadat,<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></span><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Possevino goes on to plead for the chests of the students,
and says that the ink is the price of their blood,
and the end of their studies becomes the end of their
lives. Hence one singular result of it all is, that
scholars even employ amanuenses to go to school
instead of themselves, and bring back in writing
what was said. But all that money, says Possevino,
could have been reserved for the buying of books, to

<p>Then he enforces what he has said with a piece of
university history, wherein perhaps no one of his time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
was better versed. The University of Paris, two and
a half centuries before, had legislated against dictating,
and against the Doctors who used it, and who
were dubbed <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nominatores ad pennam</i>. One century
before, the Cardinal Legate had again formulated a
law on the subject. And finally the Jesuits, "of
whom a great number are chiefly engaged in this profession,
taught by experience the evils of that system,
have long understood the necessity, not merely of moderating
it, but simply doing away with it. Wherefore
the Fathers in the universities of Portugal have
already published a part of Natural Philosophy,
whereby writing is dispensed with, room is left for
quickening genius, and much material stored up to
bring into the arena of <span class="locked">discussion."<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></span></p>

<p>What is developed to perfection can make other
things like unto itself; it is prolific. So the Aristotelian
principle has it: <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Perfectum est, quod generat
simile sibi.</i> This is the outcome and test of perfection.
Having followed the Master, therefore, till he was
complete in his own formation, we have now turned
to look in another direction, and see him reacting upon
those whom he is to form. Though much has been
said already implicitly or otherwise, on the method
and principles of this reactive process, yet something
remains, especially with regard to the lower
faculties, the literary courses. In this chapter,
we may consider the attitude which the Professors
take, singly and as a body, towards the students and
towards their own courses; and then their chief manner
of imparting knowledge, or what is called in the
<i>Ratio</i> the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prælectio</i>. In the next chapter we can
survey the principal class exercises, and the method
of school management, throughout the lower grades.
And, in the chapter after that, I shall sketch the
system of grades from the lowest to the highest.</p>

<p>1. One of the first most general rules lays it down
that the authority, in whose hands is the appointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
of Professors, "should foresee far ahead what Professors
he can have for every faculty, noting especially
those who seem to be more adapted for the work, who
are learned, diligent, and assiduous, and who are zealous
for the advancement of their students, as well in
their lectures (or lessons) as in other literary <span class="locked">exercises."<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></span>
"They are to procure the advancement of
each of their scholars in particular," says <span class="locked">Ignatius.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></span>
The Professor "is not to show himself more familiar
with one student than with another; he is to disregard
no one, to foster the studies of the poor equally
with the <span class="locked">rich."<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></span></p>

<p>These are the regular and "ordinary Professors,
who take account of their students in <span class="locked">particular."<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></span>
There can also be in a university one or more of
another kind, "who, with more solemnity than the
ordinary lecturers, treat Philosophy, Mathematical
Sciences, or any other branch, after the manner of
public <span class="locked">Professors."<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></span></p>

<p>In the lower, or literary courses the Masters must
"be good and skilled," who "seriously, and with all the
attention of their mind, work for the advancement of
their scholars, as well in what concerns learning, as in
the matter of morals. They will have to take care that
besides the Christian doctrine, which is so integral a
part of our Institute, they also give frequent exhortations,
suited to the capacity of the boys, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
devised for empty ostentation; let them endeavor to
instil solid affections of piety and love for the things
of God, and a hatred for <span class="locked">sin."<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></span></p>

<p>What is meant by "good and skilled Masters" in
these courses, we have already seen from Jouvancy's
sketch of the accomplishments proper to a teacher of
<span class="locked">Literature.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></span> If anything remained to be said on this
topic, it would only be to note and reject false
standards, by which the position or efficiency of Professors
might possibly, but incorrectly, be measured.
Thus, some five years ago, that is to say, three hundred
years later than the drawing up of the <i>Ratio</i>, I
find two such false standards distinctly repudiated;
one is the idea of gathering in just enough of doctrine
beforehand to be able, when occasion calls for it, to
develop the attainments of a Professor; another is
that which would look only to the environment
around, and would measure the intellectual formation
of men, and the supply of learning, by the estimate
commonly formed of the article, and the actual demand
for it.</p>

<p>2. If we regard not individual Professors, but the
whole moral body or faculty of them, there are two
characteristics which it may be difficult to find, or at
least to ensure, outside of an organization such as the
Society of Jesus. One is the very strict unity of
educational matter presented to the studious world.
The other is the degree of coördination and subordination
of courses professed. A word upon each.</p>

<p>The unity of matter in question, as designed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
the purposes of education, is prescribed on the strength
of a double maxim; first, that the sifting of many
opinions, by the varied and multiplied activity of
many minds, leaves a residue of matter, quite solid
enough to support a compact and reliable system of
teaching; secondly, that, in point of fact, such matter,
which I have called "a residue," is nothing else than
the basis of truth, divine and eternal; since, in clearing
away the ground, all the criteria of each order,
the natural and supernatural, have been faithfully
and assiduously regarded.</p>

<p>Hereupon, intellectual concord is felt to be the
result in the entire teaching body. Of this concord
the critics say, that it is the condition and cause of
a wider and profounder learning in the faculties at
large. Each Professor is engaged, "not in tilling
some patch of his own, but in contributing his industry
to the general field of all." Where is the
gain, they ask, "if what one establishes, another upsets,
not as if he had always excogitated something
better, but for fear he should be thought to profit by
the fruits of another's genius? Sometimes it really
makes no difference whether one or other tenet is
held; but, if we are bent on receiving no support from
another, then, for all our labor, we get no other fruit
but <span class="locked">dissension."<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></span> I presume there is not a university
anywhere but will bear witness, by its internal
history, to the justice of this remark.</p>

<p>Nor do these Fathers apprehend that reputation
for real science will suffer by such concord, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
"reputation for science does not come from opinions
contradicting one another, but from their having
agreed." They express no lofty esteem for the notoriety
which may be had, by fighting no less with
friends than with foes, and reserving admiration for
only what is at a respectable distance, and "turning
up one's nose at what is <span class="locked">near."<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></span> This pungent remark
seems to be a new and pedagogical application of the
old proverb, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Nihil vicinia molestius</i>, "Nothing more
annoying than one's neighbors!" They hold that,
upon a basis of concord, there is always room and
liberty for the exercise of talent; first, in those questions
which are manifestly indifferent; secondly, in
thinking out new distinctions and reasons, whereby
truths already certain may be made more secure still;
thirdly, in attacking the same, either when publicly
disputing, or also when actually teaching, if what
they acutely urge against a position, they more acutely
refute; fourthly, in proposing new opinions and questions,
but after they have sought the approval of the
responsible authorities, lest the labor be spent amiss.
The most learned men have always been persuaded
that there is more subtlety shown, more applause
merited and comfort enjoyed, in pursuing the lines
of approved and received thought, than in a general
license and novelty of <span class="locked">opinion.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></span> But these
critics throw out an idea of theirs, which quite possibly
will not meet with universal acceptance. They
say, "It is not every one who can build up a Theology
for himself." The remark they add is graceful,
that a modest genius does not court every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
kind of liberty, but that which is not divorced from
virtue.</p>

<p>These principles explain for us the unity of educational
matter, as presented to the studious world.
The same marshalling and husbanding of force, which
effectuates this result, operates another, akin to the
former. It is the most definite coördination and
subordination of courses, with a mutual understanding
between Professors and faculties. Where grades
exist, either in their perfect form, as in the five
stages of the classical or literary course, or in a shape
approximating to that, as in the three stages of the
philosophical triennium, such subordination is easily
secured. But, also, elsewhere the conditions of perfectly
definite outlines are laid down for courses,
which have any points of mutual contact.</p>

<p>This may be illustrated by some rules of the <i>Ratio</i>.
The two Professors of Dogmatic Theology are to
consider themselves dispensed from commenting on
questions proper to Sacred Scripture, from treating
philosophical matters, from evolving cases of Moral
Theology. The Professor of Moral Theology is to
despatch with the briefest definitions the matter
which belongs to dogma. The Professor of Holy
Scripture is desired not to go at length into points of
controverted Theology. The Professor of Ecclesiastical
History need not treat canons or dogma. The
Professor of Canon Law will not touch Theology or
Public Right, any more than his time permits, and
the necessary understanding of Canon Law requires.
The same reserve is practised between Theology in
general, and Philosophy. Thus a Professor of Moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Theology despatches perhaps in ten minutes the definition
of Natural Law, upon which he knows two days
are spent by the Professor of Moral Philosophy.</p>

<p>Half a century later, this question of coördination
received a still fuller treatment at the hands of the
General Francis Piccolomini. After requiring that
philosophers and theologians alike finish conscientiously
all the matter assigned for each year, he will
not allow that "the example of authors who have
mixed up subjects, or have followed out their questions
into mere minutiæ, can be cited as of any weight
with our Professors. For, whatever is to be thought
of them, this method is not opportune for practical
teaching in the schools." The General scouts the
idea of "exploring the treasure-house of possibilities,"
to find out new questions; for there is reason
to fear that "while folks search about for truths not
ascertained, they will catch at chimeras and <span class="locked">shadows."<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></span>
Hence, as the <i>Ratio</i> prescribes, "opinions
which are useless, obsolete, absurd, manifestly false,
are not to receive treatment." The Professors are to
run rapidly through questions which are easy. In
Holy Scripture, difficult passages are not to be dwelt
on indefinitely, nor too much time to be given to
chronological computations, or topological surveys of
the Holy Land.</p>

<p>In facing the objection, that all this entails a great
expenditure of thought and matter, when Professors
must despatch in such short courses what might well
be treated in longer terms, the preliminary <i>Ratio</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
draws a sharp line of demarcation between other universities
and those conducted by Jesuits. "Whatever
is the custom in other universities, our method is
very different from theirs, so that no less progress
can be made in our schools during four years, than in
others during five; because our Professors are for the
most part more laborious; we have more numerous
exercises; our Society, as standing in need of many
workmen, requires that perfection of science which is
necessary for its men, not that otiose method of others,
who, having no motive of this kind to make them expeditious,
divide up into many lectures what could
well be treated in fewer; their vacations too are for
the most part longer and more <span class="locked">frequent."<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></span></p>

<p><i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ex ungue leonem</i>, "You can tell a lion by his paw."
Let it appear that the brevity which you study is
necessitated by your limits of time; let discernment
be conspicuous in your selection of matter, whether
to treat summarily or to treat copiously; let the alternate
courses supplement one another, so that
what had to be skimmed over in one quadriennium is
dilated upon more at large in your next; then, say
the Fathers, the authority which the Professors enjoy
with ecclesiastical dignitaries will not suffer the
detriment anticipated by some, when we give condensed
and accurate treatment in a shorter time of
what is usually spread out through a <span class="locked">longer.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></span> The
paw shows the lion.</p>

<p>3. We may proceed now to the typical form of
Jesuit instruction. It is called <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">prælectio</i>. This word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
is largely the equivalent of "lecturing," in the higher
faculties; of "explanation," in the lower. In either
case, however, it is something specific. For this
reason, and because I shall have to use the word
often, I may be allowed to put it in an English dress,
and speak of "prelection."</p>

<p>Its form, as a lecture in the higher faculties, is
conceived thus: The whole proposition, which is
advanced, is to be delivered consecutively, without
interposing any stoppages. Then it should be repeated
in the same words; and this will be taken by
the students as a sign that it is to be written down;
and the delivery of it should be marked by such inflections,
and proceed at such a pace, especially in its
obscure and finer points, that the students may readily
distinguish between what is to be written and what
is not. Now, while the proposition is thus being
taken down, the lecturer ought not to advance new
ideas, but should dally with the same, either explaining
it in more phrases or clearer ones, or adducing an
example or similitude, or amplifying the topic, or
drawing out the same logical sequence in another
order, so as to make it stand out more distinctly, or
throwing out a reason or two, which, however, it is
not necessary for them to note. Indeed, if the Professor
brings his own papers into the school, he
might have in them some select phrases, brief but not
obscure, in which he sums up in few words the gist
of the propositions. Longer development they will
receive only in the explanation, which is then to be
<span class="locked">given.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></span> In that, the Professor will endeavor to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
his thesis, not so much by the number of arguments,
as by their weight. He should not be excessive in
adducing authorities. And it belongs to his dignity,
as a Master, scarcely ever to quote an author whom
he has not himself <span class="locked">read.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></span></p>

<p>In the grade of Rhetoric, which is the highest of
the literary or classical course, the prelection is
double; one is upon the art of eloquence, wherein
precepts are explained; the other is upon an author,
and has for its object the development of style. Taking
up an author such as Cicero, the Professor will,
in the first place, make clear the sense of the passage.
Secondly, the artistic structure is to be analyzed and
demonstrated: the <i>Ratio</i> here details the elements of
this analysis. Thirdly, other passages which are
similar in thought or expression are to be adduced;
other orators and poets, whether in the classics or
in the vernacular, are to be cited as employing the
same principles of art, in persuading or narrating.
Fourthly, if the matter allows of it, the thoughts
expressed by the author are to be confirmed by what
wise men have said on the same subject. Fifthly,
whatever else will conduce to ornamenting the passage
is here in place, from history, mythology, erudition
of every kind. Finally, the words are to be
weighed singly; their propriety of use, their beauty,
variety, rhythm to be commented upon. The whole
of this treatment, however, does not come within the
limits of each and every <span class="locked">lesson.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></span> The "erudition" for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
this grade is defined to comprise "the history and
manners of nations, the authority of various writers,
and all learning, but sparingly, to suit the capacity
of the <span class="locked">scholars."<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></span></p>

<p>The prelection on the precepts or rules, "the power
of which," says the <i>Ratio</i>, "is very great for the purposes
of oratory," comprises six points. Cicero is
the rhetorician who supplies the precepts; but Quintilian
and Aristotle may also be used. First, the
meaning of the rule is to be explained. Secondly,
upon the same rule, the rhetoricians are to be collated.
Thirdly, some reason for the rule is to be expounded.
Fourthly, some striking passages from prose writers,
and also from poets, are to be adduced in exemplification
of the rule. Fifthly, if anything in the way of
varied erudition makes to the purpose, it is to be
added. Lastly, an indication should be given how
this principle of art can be turned to use by ourselves;
the style in which this is done must be marked
by the most absolute choice and finish of diction <span class="locked">possible.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></span></p>

<p>In the grade of Humanity, which is immediately
below Rhetoric, the prelection is to be lightly adorned
from time to time with the ornaments of erudition,
as far as the passage requires. The Master should
rather expatiate to the fullest extent upon the genius of
the Latin tongue, on the force and etymology of words
as shown by approved authors, on the use and variety
of phrases, with a view to imitation. Here, as in
other rules of this kind, we may notice the degree of
progress made in the native tongues during two centuries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
and a half. While the <i>Ratio</i> of 1599 adds
these words: "Nor let him think it out of his way to
bring forward something from the vernacular, if it
presents anything specially idiomatic for rendering
the idea, or offers some remarkable construction;"
the revised <i>Ratio</i> of 1832 substitutes these words:
"Let him expatiate on a comparison between the
genius of both tongues, with a view to imitation."
When he is explaining a prose author, he should investigate
the precepts of art, as exemplified therein.
Lastly, if he thinks fit, he can give a version, but
a most elegant one, of the whole passage into the
mother <span class="locked">tongue.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></span> Greek has its own form of prelection.</p>

<p>As to the "prose writer" just mentioned, the manner
of treating an historical writer in Humanity,
which is otherwise called the class of Poetry, will
serve by the way to illustrate the difference between
what is recognized as the staple of studies in a class,
and what comes in as subsidiary&mdash;a most essential
distinction, characterizing this system of literary
teaching. The critics of 1586 advert to it clearly.
After showing the importance of including the study
of historians in the course of Poetry, they say:
"This will not be too onerous to the Preceptor; for
the style of history is plainer and more lucid, so as
not to need great study; and it would be enough to
explain the course of events, as they are narrated by
the author, so that he need not consult other authors
who have written on the same matter. The prelection
of the historian ought to be easy; after rendering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
a sentence of the author, the words may be lightly
commented upon, and only such as have some obscurity
hanging about them." The historians of whom
there is question here, are Cæsar, Sallust, Q. Curtius,
Justin, Tacitus, <span class="locked">Livy.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></span></p>

<p>"In both classes of Rhetoric and Humanities, not
everything indiscriminately is to be dictated and
taken down, but only certain interpretations of difficult
passages, which are not readily obvious to
every one, or which the Master has elaborated as the
outcome of his personal study; besides, some rather
striking remarks on various passages of the author
under examination, such annotations as the commentators
give, who edit books of various readings. This
will befit the Master's dignity, and will be useful for
the young men to <span class="locked">know."<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></span></p>

<p>The grades of Grammar have respectively their
own forms of prelection, given in detail by the final
<i>Ratio</i>. It will be enough for us to sketch the general
form of the earlier <span class="locked">critics.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></span></p>

<p>According as it is a grammar or an author that is
being explained, a very different method of prelection
is to be followed. In the grammar, we acquire a
fund of precepts; in an author, a store of words and
phrases. Wherefore, in the books of grammar, the
boys must understand perfectly the things explained;
they need not attend scrupulously to the words there,
with a view to forming style. But, in the letters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Cicero, and other texts of the kind, it is not so much
the substance of the sentences, as the words and
phrases that are of chief consequence; the significance
and force of his thoughts are to be reserved for the
higher classes, when the students are no longer mere
boys.</p>

<p>In the classes of Grammar then, let the Master
follow this method of explaining Cicero, or any other
author. First, he will sketch, in the briefest way,
the meaning of the author, and the connection between
what has gone before and what is now to be explained.
Then he will give a version of the period literally,
preserving to the utmost the collocation of words, as
they stand in the author; and also the figures employed.
As to the collocation or arrangement of the
words, this is of such consequence that sometimes,
if a single word is put out of its place, the whole
thought seems to lose its force and fall flat. Herein,
too, is perceived that rhythmic flow of the style, which
of itself, even if other ornaments are wanting, pleases
the ear wonderfully and gratifies the mind. Thirdly,
the whole period is to be resolved analytically into
its structural elements, so that the boys understand
distinctly what every word governs; and their attention
should be directed to some useful points of good
Latinity. As to this structural analysis, I may be
allowed the passing remark, which is familiar to every
judge of a classical education, that the disciplinary
value of literary studies reaches here its highest
degree of mental exercise; and that the two classical
tongues, Latin and Greek, are altogether eminent as
supplying materials for this exercise, in their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
native structure; which, in the Latin, is an architectural
build, characteristic of the reasoning Roman
mind; and, in the Greek, is a subtle delicacy of conception
and tracery, reflecting the art, the grace and
versatility of Athens and the Ionian Isles.</p>

<p>After this, each word is to be examined, as to
what it signifies, and to what uses it may be applied;
the boy is to understand, as far as may be, the original
and proper idea and force of every word, not merely
its general significance, as in a shadowy outline; he
should know, too, the phrases in his native tongue,
which correspond with precision and propriety to the
Latin. The metaphors and the figurative use of
words, especially as found in Cicero, are to be explained
to the boys in an extremely plain <span class="locked">manner,<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></span>
and by examples drawn from the plainest objects.
Unless this use of words is understood, the true and
genuine knowledge of the tongue is seriously obstructed.
Then, picking out the more elegant turns
of style, the Master will dictate them to the scholars,
and afterwards require the use and imitation of these
phrases in their themes. Lastly, he will go back
and translate the words of the author over again, as
he did at the beginning; and, if need be, do so a third
and a fourth time.</p>

<p>As to writing, during all this, let him forbid them
absolutely to take down a single letter, except when
told. What he does dictate to them, he is to finish
within the time of the prelection, and not prolong
this time for the sake of the writing. It happens
now and then that, with much labor, waste of time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
and to no good purpose whatever, the boys take down,
and preserve with diligence, a set of notes which have
not been thought out very judiciously nor been arranged
very carefully,&mdash;notes simply trivial, common,
badly patched together, sometimes worse than
worthless; and these notes they commit to paper, in
wretched handwriting, full of mistakes and errors.
Therefore, let the dictation be only of a few points,
and those extremely select.</p>

<p>The Masters are to be on their guard, lest private
tutors at the boys' homes explain new lessons to them.
These tutors have merely to repeat with the boys
what has been heard in class. Otherwise, the fruit
of the good explanation which is received at school is
lost at home.</p>

<p>Repetition is now in order. Two principles govern
this exercise. First, "what has often been repeated
sinks deeper into the <span class="locked">mind."<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></span> Secondly, "the industry
of youths flags under nothing so much as <span class="locked">satiety."<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></span>
As soon, therefore, as the prelection is over, the Professor
is to require at once an account of all that he
has said, and he is to see that the whole line of his
explanation is followed in the repetition. As if this
seemed to imply that only the best scholars were to
be called upon, the critics go on to note that not all
of what has been explained should be repeated by one
only, but that as many as possible should be practised
every day. The Master should not follow the order
in which the boys are seated, but take them here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
there. However, the first to be called on are those
more advanced; then, the duller, or perhaps lazier
ones, and these should rather be asked oftener, to be
kept up to the <span class="locked">mark.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></span></p>

<p>The final <i>Ratio</i> notes that the daily lesson should
not exceed four lines in the lowest class of Grammar;
seven in Middle Grammar. There is, as I have
already observed, a prelection proper to grammatical
rules; also to Greek, whether it be in the grammar or
in an author. Proportion in width and depth of
matter is adjusted to each grade. A careful dictation
in the vernacular is to be given, which, when
rendered into Latin or Greek, will exemplify the precepts
explained, or the use of the phrases already dictated.
And one part of the school exercises, from the
lowest class up to Rhetoric, is a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">concertatio</i> between
rivals, which is a lively discussion either upon matters
explained in the prelections, or upon one another's
compositions. In this field of debate, as is natural,
the activity of the students grows, both in the extent
of the field to be covered, and in the depth of erudition
required, according as the grades are mounted.
And it is carried out of the class-room into select
societies, called "academies," the members whereof,
whether grammarians or <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">littérateurs</i>, conduct their
debates, give their own prelections or repeat a choice
one of their Professor's, award a place in the archives
to some specially meritorious production; and they
conduct all these exercises in exact keeping with
their actual prelections and studies. Nor do they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
yield an inch in gravity or dignity to the great
academy of theologians and <span class="locked">philosophers.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></span></p>

<p>As to the native tongue, one of the earliest systems
of studies in the Society, prior to the general <i>Ratio</i>
by about forty years, lays down for the middle class
of Grammar, that "on Mondays and Wednesdays the
boys will receive the themes in Bohemian and German
for their epistolary <span class="locked">exercises."<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></span> This document
is probably from the pen of Peter Canisius, soon
after the colleges were founded at Prague, Ingolstadt
and Cologne. In a directive memorial of 1602, drawn
up for Mayence by Father Ferdinand Alber, a postscript
is added to the effect, "Let exercise in the
German tongue be <span class="locked">furthered."<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></span> Jouvancy lays down
the practice in this manner: "After the correction
and dictation of the written exercises, the Latin
author is rendered into the mother tongue, or a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">concertatio</i>
is held. These two exercises can be held on
alternate days, if there is not enough of time every
day for both. In rendering the author into the vernacular,
you will observe three things: first, the idiom
of the vernacular, and its agreement in construction
with the Latin, or else its disagreement, so that the
scholars learn each tongue by the other; secondly,
the proper turns and elegance of the Latin style;
finally, the thoughts of the author, as having a moral
bearing, and as calculated to form and mould the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
judgment of the boys; also the ways of men, the
punishments of the wicked, the maxims of sages.
Some part of an historical author should be given
sometimes for their written exercise, to translate into
the mother tongue; or it may be added, as an appendix,
to a shorter theme. Let the boys hold a discussion
among themselves upon the merits of the
translation; they can write in that narrative style, to
win the best places in class; as also, at the close of
the year, for the premiums. However, the whole
time of class is not to be taken up by such translations,
as happens sometimes with negligent Masters,
who shirk the labor of the prelection, and of the correction
of themes. While the boys dispute among
themselves on the precepts of grammar, poetry, or
eloquence, one stands against many, or several against
several. The subject, time, and manner of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">concertatio</i>
is to be defined beforehand; umpires and judges
are to be appointed, prizes for the victors, penalties
for the vanquished. The others, who are merely listening
during the contest, will show in writing what
fruit they have derived from it, or will be asked
questions <span class="locked">thereupon."<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></span></p>

<p>In the following <span class="locked">article,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></span> the same writer gives
several specimens of a prelection in Cicero, Virgil,
Phædrus, as adapted to the different classes. They
are only passages. The whole of this system goes by
passages, taken consecutively, until a whole piece
has been mastered by the students. For it is in the
prior perfection of detail that perfection in a larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
compass is attained. And we may also note that it
is only in the original productions of perfect Masters
in style, that detail can ever be adequately studied.
The understanding and enjoyment of an entire masterpiece,
taken as a whole, is by every law of nature and
of art an easy resultant of understanding the parts.
If any writers on pedagogy have thought that no student
could "understand and take pleasure" in an
original classic, and therefore have advocated the
reading of translations as a means of receiving the
"literary impressions," I fear that we need only point
to the style of literary writing which seems to have
resulted from doing things in this second-hand fashion&mdash;if
indeed it is even second-hand. For, after all,
style itself never appears in a translation; only the
thoughts are translated. Thoughts are the soul of
style; its expression was the body; each fitted the
other in the classic original; and, in an eminent mutual
fitness, an eminent style was being studied. The
best translation of a classic piece has never done more
than produce a bare equivalent. Wherefore, if with
the striking original no thorough work has been done,
it is more than probable that, in the results, nothing
original and striking will ever be done.</p>

<p>This system of prelection, which in addition to the
perfection of its <i>technique</i>, required erudition from
every branch of <span class="locked">learning,<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></span> made of the Professor anything
but a technical pedagogue. Voltaire noticed it,
speaking of his own Professor. "Nothing will efface
from my heart," he wrote to Père de la Tour, Rector<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
of the Collège Louis-le-Grand, "the memory of
Father Porée, who is equally dear to all that studied
under him. Never did man make study and virtue
more amiable. The hours of his lessons were delicious
hours to us. And I should have wished that it
was the custom at Paris, as it used to be at Athens,
that one, at any age, could listen to such lectures. I
should often go to hear them. I have had the good
fortune to be formed by more than one Jesuit of the
character of Père Porée, and I know that he has successors
worthy of <span class="locked">him."<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></span></p>

<p>The productions of such Professors replenished
the literature of the classics, as we may see in the
great editions, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bibliothecæ classicæ</i>, published during
the present century. Father De la Cerda of Toledo,
in his three folio volumes on Virgil, in 1617, gave
to literature an encyclopædia of political and moral
observations, including geography, history, and the
natural <span class="locked">sciences.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></span> His technical work was not inferior;
for his "Grammatical Institutions" became in
1613, by an exclusive privilege, the standard of all
the public schools in Spain. Father Nicholas Abram,
whose "Epitome of Greek Precepts in Latin Verse"
went through fifty editions in twenty-two years, published
in 1632, while Professor at the College of Pont-à-Mousson,
two volumes octavo on Virgil, which were
then republished constantly at Rouen, Paris, Toulouse,
Poitiers, Lyons, <span class="locked">etc.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></span> Undertaking the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
labor, in behalf of Cicero, he issued two volumes folio,
"by which John George Grævius profited in his edition
of Cicero, Amsterdam, 1699; as well as the editor of
Cambridge, whose work appeared in 1699, 1710, and
<span class="locked">1717."<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></span> Father De la Rue's (Carolus Ruæus) Delphin
Virgil is a familiar work in France, Holland,
England; so, too, De Merouville's Delphin edition of
Cicero, which was often reproduced at Cambridge,
London, Dublin, etc. The same we see with regard
to Sanadon on Horace, Brumoy's great work on the
Greek Drama, René Rapin's various critical and
poetical works; and so of the rest. Of Père Rapin's
thirty-five works, there are few which were not translated
into various European languages; and Oxford,
London, Cambridge, have been among the most active
centres of republication, or translation into <span class="locked">English.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></span></p>

<p>4. This chapter, which has extended beyond the
usual limits, cannot close better than with a word on
books, a matter intimately connected with its subject.
The Fathers of 1586 set down some principles with
regard to the proper supply and use of books, as well
as the expurgation of the classical standard <span class="locked">works;<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></span>
and accordingly the <i>Ratio</i> of 1599 ordains that "the
students are neither to be without useful books, nor
to abound in useless <span class="locked">ones."<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></span> A multitude is considered
useless, because "it oppresses the mind, and interferes
with the convenient preparation of the lesson.
Of books by more recent authors few are to be allowed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
and those very carefully selected." Yet, "a variety
of authors gives a richer vein to the boys, and makes
imitation <span class="locked">easier."<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></span> Here the Fathers proceed to give
directions for the composition of an entirely new kind
of work, which would be of great use in the colleges.
It is exactly the species so well known in our days
under the various titles of "Precepts of Rhetoric,"
"Art of Composition," etc. As the development of
pedagogical literature, which we took note of in a former
<span class="locked">chapter,<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></span> had already made some progress, the
critics say: "Some one most versed in all these matters
should be deputed to gather whatever is best in
this line, and to compile in one treatise, written in
an elegant style, all that he has selected, about the
art of writing epigrams, elegies, odes, eclogues, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sylvæ</i>
(that is, materials, "objects"), comedies, tragedies,
epopœiæ, a brief method of chronology; explaining
also what is the historical (or narrative) style, the
poetic, the epistolary, the different kinds of speaking,
and other such matters, all to be illustrated by <span class="locked">examples."<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></span>
Elsewhere they call for a similar work of
a higher order, on the Art of Oratory. The sources
which they designate for such a compilation are "the
numerous publications of our Professors of Rhetoric,
as well on the art itself, as on classical <span class="locked">orations."<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></span>
These <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">compendia</i>, or text-books, were a new idea in
education.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE CLASSICAL LITERATURES. SCHOOL MANAGEMENT
AND CONTROL.</span></h2>

<p>The subject of Literary Exercises and School Management
is treated in such a manner by the critics of
1586, that justice could be done to it, only by transcribing,
word for word, the several chapters of the
preliminary <i>Ratio</i>. As that is impossible, within the
limits of space remaining, I shall endeavor to trace
the outline.</p>

<p>1. There is one fundamental point, however, which
should be touched on, to meet a latent query in the
mind. It refers to the kind of education projected
throughout. It is evidently not a special training
which is contemplated; not the training of specialists,
or technical students. All through the system, the
field of pedagogical activity is that of a general
culture; and, therefore, properly an education. The
result aimed at is a general one, that of developing
in the young mind all fundamental qualities; of
adjusting it, by the early development of all natural
fitnesses, to any special work of thought and labor in
the mature life of the future. It would lay a solid
substructure, in the whole mind and character, for
any superstructure of science, professional and special;
also for the entire building up of moral life, civil and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
religious. That such a general culture should go
before the special seems to be obvious. To supplant
it by the special, or even to abridge the process, is
not only to sacrifice the general culture; it has a more
serious effect than that. By a false economy, it
cramps, curtails, and reduces to the smallest proportions
whatever possibilities existed of general and
special qualifications in the youthful mind. Without
a broad, radical formation below, the amplitude of
organic growth above must necessarily fall short; the
roots underneath not having shot out, the development
above is wanting in vigor, to ramify according
to its environment, and use its opportunities. In a
boy's mind, there is needed a suppleness of general
powers, as only the young mind can be made supple,
while at the same time it is preëminently apt to be
general. It is what Seneca calls <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">curiosum ingenium</i>,
"an inquisitive genius," open to everything, and prying
to open everything. Memory is then at its flourishing
stage, ready to be cultivated throughout the
extent of a potential vastness, which will never again
be experienced in life. If cultivated richly in its
season, it will be capable afterwards of every kind of
ready yield, according to its acquired tenacity, and
according to the richness of the seed deposited in it.
The imagination, too, is at the stage of impressionable
and vital expansion, and is keenly sensitive to
the lights and shades of objective life. These are
either brought under its observation, or, better still,
are pictured for it in beautiful literature; since the
fine fancy of great minds paints nature, as nature
herself is not found dressed at every one's door. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
opening judgment also is receptive of the thoughts
and wisdom, which other minds have thought out and
handed down, encasing it, as they did so, in a style
worthy of their own vigor, and presenting it as the
heritage of the past to the present, of the wise old
age of the world to its youth, which may be wiser
still. And thus in each individual youth, the judgment
being tenderly nursed, and learning ripening
with age, what was before in the memory passes
gradually into the whole character and competency of
the man.</p>

<p>In the system which we are considering, the instrument
employed for working these effects is a literature
in the hands of a competent teacher; it is
a great literature, and a double one. The great literatures
of Rome and Greece have always been considered
adequate instruments of universal culture.
Under a literary aspect, the eloquence and poetry of
Greece had been the mistress of Roman excellence.
Under a philological aspect, the Latin tongue has
been the principal basis of our modern languages, as
formed in the history of Christendom. In both of
them, the varied elements of richest thought are
brought into contact with the undeveloped, but developing
nature of the youth; glimpses of human life, individual,
social, and political, favor his inquiring eyes,
and lead him to feel the finest springs of human sentiment.
Better still, he feels these springs as touched
by the greatest masters of expression; and he conceives
thought as rendered in a style worthy of the
greatest thinkers; and that, in languages, one of
them the most delicately organized, the other perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
the most systematically elaborated, of all tongues
living or extinct. And, besides, these two literatures
come down to us, bearing in their own right what no
other tongues can convey. Not as translations, which,
in their best form, exhibit only a respectable degree
of mendicancy, and represent other men's living
thoughts in a decent misfit, these two literatures
come down to us bearing in their own right all the
historic memories of antiquity, as well sacred as profane;
all the masterpieces of eloquence and poetry,
belonging to no less than two out of the very few
great epochs, those of Pericles and Augustus; all
human philosophy, from Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle,
down to St. Thomas Aquinas, and, further
down, to Leibnitz and Newton, both of them men of
classical letters; in fine, all the traditions, the Faith,
and Divinity of Christendom.</p>

<p>To these considerations we may add one more
characteristic of the classical literatures, as instruments
in the class-room, and we shall have seen
enough on our present topic, to understand the theory
which underlies the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>. These tongues
are dead. They are not the language of common life.
They are not picked up by instinct, and without
reflection. Everything has to be learned by system,
rule, and formula. The relations of grammar and
logic must be attended to with deliberation. Thought
and judgment are constantly exercised in assigning
the exact equivalents of the mother tongue for every
phrase of the original. The coincidence of construction
is too little, the community of idiomatic thought
too remote, for the boy's mind to catch at the idea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
by force of that preëstablished harmony which exists
among most modern tongues. Only the law of thought
and logic guides him, with the assistance of a teacher
to lead the way, and reassure his struggling conception.</p>

<p>And when, in the last instance, the boy comes to
write and to speak the language so learned, and quickens
it, though dead, with the very life of actual
speech which makes modern languages live, we have
the supreme test and proof of successful toil, that
which consists in the power to reproduce. We have
also the very specific advantage, in this case, that the
toil has been of the most valuable kind; it has been
personal labor, spent in the freshness of life on complete
self-culture. For that great law of all success
in life, personal labor, has been honored in the most
remunerative way, by cultivating memory, exercising
judgment, and acquiring in the same thoughtful, reflective
manner two languages together, Latin and
the mother tongue, Greek and the mother tongue,
each systematically helping the others by analogy
and contrast. And, withal, what is more congenial to
the young than letters, language, talk?</p>

<p>As to the working of this Jesuit system, it is very
much of a commonplace, in pedagogic history, that
"a handsome style" was aimed at, and a handsome
style was the outcome. The Scottish Professor,
whom I quoted on a former occasion, states very exactly
the value of this result. Speaking of the Structure
of Sentences, he says: "Logic and Rhetoric
have here, as in many cases, a strict connection; and
he that is learning to arrange his sentences with order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
is learning to think with accuracy and order; an observation
which alone would justify all the care and
attention we have bestowed on this <span class="locked">subject."<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></span> And,
in another connection, he quotes, with the approval
which it merits, the Roman rhetorician's saying:
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Curam verborum, rerum volo esse sollicitudinem</i>, "I
would have a sufficient care be given to the diction,
but the thoughts must be the object of scrupulous <span class="locked">attention."<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></span>
This latter principle, of diction first and
matter afterwards, as translated into a process of
educational development, assigns, in the <i>Ratio</i>, five
grades, or seven years, more or less, to be spent on the
acquirement of style, chiefly as to its body, or, if you
like, its form; then two great courses of Science,
natural and revealed, or Philosophy and Theology,
for the acquirement of the same style, chiefly as to
its soul, or, if you wish so to call it, the substratum
of matter. From both together issues the thoroughly
cultured man; as the well-known phrase has it: <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le
style c'est l'homme</i>, "A style is the man himself."
And, if we have just had occasion to take notice that
two of the great literary epochs of the world's history,
those of Pericles and Augustus, are made present to
us by the classical literatures, it is a subject of historical
verification that a third great literary epoch,
the age of Louis XIV, was created under the influence
of this system.</p>

<p>The manner in which the critics of 1586 discuss the
question of Greek shows the practical eye they kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
on the requirements of actual life, and the conditions
of concrete <span class="locked">surroundings.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></span> Their conclusions are embodied
in a rule of the Director or Prefect of Studies:
"He should not grant an immunity, particularly for
any length of time, from either versification or Greek,
except for a grave <span class="locked">reason."<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this theme there is a facetious touch in the report
of the Upper German Province, which was sent
to Father Aquaviva some three years after the final
<i>Ratio</i> was published. The deputies say: "Some ask
for an exemption from Greek and versification, in
behalf of the older monks and nobles. But as the
rule itself insinuates that an exception can be made,
for a sufficiently grave cause, there is no need of a
change. If we are facile in the matter, whether with
monks or nobles, we shall end by eliminating Greek
altogether. But, if one is seen to be altogether inept
and incapable, the impossibility of the thing exempts
him; for, if God himself does not enjoin impossibilities,
why, neither should we impose Greek on
such disciples." Father Aquaviva replies, "That is
<span class="locked">correct."<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></span></p>

<p>2. Under the head of Exercises, the preliminary
<i>Ratio</i> treats elaborately and minutely the literary direction
of a class. The subjects are orthography, and
all that pertains to it; the prelection, as explained
before; the repetitions, daily themes, and the method
of daily correction; the recitation of lessons by heart;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
parsing; and the speaking of Latin. Jouvancy gives
the order of the daily class exercises. And he makes
this reflection: Few things are to be taught in each
class, but accurately, so that they remain in the
minds of the boys; the teacher is to remember that
these young intellects are like vases with a narrow
orifice, which waste the liquid, if it is poured in copiously,
but take it all, if it comes in by <span class="locked">drops.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></span></p>

<p>There are, besides, a number of aids to School
Management. These are the division of the class
into parties of ten apiece, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">decuriæ</i>; the exposition,
once or twice a month, of some passage by a student,
in the presence of invited friends; contests between
rivals or parties; the delivery of an original piece or
else an oratorical contest, every week; the exhibition
or delivery of original poems; the annual distribution
of premiums; the use of the stage, when "the boys
can produce some specimen of their studies, their
delivery and powers of memory." The composition
of the tragedy and minor drama devolves, as we saw
before, upon the Professors of Rhetoric and Poetry.</p>

<p>A general condition in the management of a class
is absolute silence and attention. Besides, it belongs
to the college programme to insure application, not
only in school to class exercises, but out of school
to private study, especially when holidays intervene.
The usual weekly relaxations scarcely rise to the rank
of "holidays." For the amount of time to be assigned
in private study to composition and other work is
part of the daily order, whether the students be
<i>alumni</i>, day-scholars, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictores</i>, boarders. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
must have enough to occupy them, "that the boys be
deterred from roaming about to their hurt." The
same applies to the ordinary intervals between school
hours, "particularly," say the Fathers, "on the days
in summer, when there is much time in the early
afternoon, before classes are resumed; and we hear
the court-yard resounding with cries and noisy pastimes,
hour after <span class="locked">hour."<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></span></p>

<p>Boys were the same genus then as now. It took
all the efficacy of a benign firmness to control that
element which tries the experience of every age.
The German Fathers draw a graphic picture of these
sixteenth century boys. They are commenting on
the rule which requires the Prefect of Studies at the
end of school to be on the ground and supervise.
They write thus to Father Aquaviva: "Many object
to this; but it seems reasonable. For, if somebody
is not on hand, some one whom the scholars revere,
then like a <span class="locked">herd,<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></span> all in a heap, they will fill the
whole place with their yells and uproar, their tussling,
laughter, and jostling. Now, it is necessary to
require the observance of decorum on the part of
our scholars; since, if we leave room anywhere for
unmannerliness, it will get at once into the school-rooms
and ruin <span class="locked">everything."<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></span> In this sense, a certain
small number of rules in the <i>Ratio</i>, only fifteen in
number, and very short, are directly presented to
the students for their observance. "None of our
students shall come to college with arms, poniards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
knives, or anything else that is prohibited, according
to the circumstances of time or place." Swords and
daggers were part of a gentleman's personal equipment
in those times. "They must abstain entirely
from swearing, injurious language or actions, detraction,
lies, forbidden games, from places, too, that are
dangerous, or are forbidden by the Prefect of Schools;
in fine, from everything which is adverse to purity of
morals." Other rules follow, equally radical for
those times, and reconstructive of education for the
<span class="locked">future.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></span></p>

<p>For, in these days of ours, we are not accustomed
to see students walk in and out of a lecture room as
they choose. And many other inconveniences of the
sixteenth century are not usual with us. But the
reason is, that we come three hundred years later
than those times, and are enjoying the fruits of other
people's labors.</p>

<p>An ascendency of personal tact and address, conspicuous
in the Jesuit teachers, is usually commented
upon and referred to some cause or other, in themselves
or in the general organization of the Society.
Omitting that, I prefer to designate one secret of control,
which is full of significance, though not so
likely to arrest attention. It is an insensible method
of organization, making its way among the youths
themselves, and subserving the purpose of general
collegiate control. There were, in all, four classes of
auditors, mingled together, and intermingling their
influences. That of the strongest of course preponderated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
There were Jesuits themselves in the higher
courses. There were boarders, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictores</i>, who remained
for ten, or rather eleven months of the year,
entirely under the control and direction of the Fathers.
Among these were whole houses of Religious or Ecclesiastics.
Besides, there were <i>alumni</i>, day scholars,
that great body of students originally contemplated
in the Constitution of Ignatius. These, however,
owing to their divided life, partly at school, partly
at home, were not found to represent, as a rule, the
fullest effects of the education. Finally, there were
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">externi</i>, external students, such as not being entered
on the books, still attended lectures; and to this
category we must refer such general gatherings as
those several thousand hearers, who were in attendance
for hours, before the time, at Father Maldonado's
lectures in Paris, and made him go out into the open
air to satisfy all. Now, besides the bond of affection
which attached scholars to the Professors, there was
another bond, that of their character as Sodalists.
This character denoted membership in the Sodality
of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a religious association
which is most highly commended in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>,
and which gathered into itself all that was
excellent in the body of students. The literary and
scientific "academies" were recruited only from the
Sodality. Thus, by a double process, an aristocracy
of virtue and talent was created among the students
themselves, tending not only to the maintenance of
order, but to the active development of all those qualities
which an educational system most desires.</p>

<span class="subhead">EXAMINATIONS AND GRADUATION. SCHEDULE
OF GRADES AND COURSES.</span></h2>

<p>1. All examinations, as projected by the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio
Studiorum</i>, are conducted by word of mouth. Writing
enters the examinations, only when the written
word itself is the subject of investigation. Thus, in
the grades of the literary course, the composition of
the student, from its elementary qualities of spelling,
punctuation, grammar, up to the most varied forms
and species of style, comes under examination for
advancing to the next grade. But even then, after
each of the three examiners has inspected carefully
the written composition, and consulted the Master's
reports of the individual's progress during the year,
they call in the writer, submit his paper to him, and
subject him to an oral investigation upon it. After
that, they proceed to the other branches, all by word
of mouth.</p>

<p>In the higher courses, where style is no longer a
matter of study, writing never appears in examinations.
Written dissertations, special lectures, literary
pieces of all kinds, composed for certain occasions, are
merely a part thenceforth of the exercises incident to
those courses.</p>

<p>To speak here only of Grammar and the Humanities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
each new-comer, on presentation of the credentials
required, is examined by the Director or Prefect
of Studies, who "places him in the class, and with
the Professor, adapted to the boy's qualifications; in
such a manner, however, that the young person be
rather worthy of the class above, than unworthy of
the class in which he is <span class="locked">placed."<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></span> It is the remark
of the earlier critics, that "severity must be practised
in examinations, since it is more injurious for boys to
ascend a grade, when not fit, than, if really fit, to be
kept where they are; and, in addition to that, if they
are advanced when not qualified, they create no slight
disturbance in the upper <span class="locked">class."<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></span></p>

<p>Into the lowest grade, neither youths advanced in
age, nor boys of very tender years, are to be admitted.
The plea that parents merely want the children to be
in good hands is not a sufficient reason for taking
them; the only exception is for young boys who are
really far advanced for their years.</p>

<p>These conditions of age, and sufficient preparation
for entering the classical course, illustrate very distinctly
several features of the policy which the
Society pursued. Father Joseph Calasanzio, a priest
of great zeal, petitioned the Rector of the Roman
College, which was flourishing with more than two
thousand students, to open some schools for the unprovided
children of Rome. There is a Latin word
coined from the first four letters of the alphabet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
for designating this elementary class of scholars,
who are not yet qualified for literature. The word is
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">abecedarii</i>. The term is employed both in the Constitution
of Loyola and in the <i>Ratio</i>. The Rector
declined. Father Joseph applied to the General
Claudius Aquaviva. He too declined; he referred to
the Constitution of the Society, which had been distinctly
and in all its parts approved by the Popes.
Unable to have his idea carried out by the Jesuits,
Father Joseph opened his first "Pious School" in
Rome, which was soon frequented by 1200 little boys,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">abecedarii</i>. After the founder's death in 1648, his
work spread into the vast system of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Scuole Pie</i>. In
our times, the revised <i>Ratio</i> of 1832 recognizes the
element of Preparatory Departments. It merely
requires that they be entirely under the same jurisdiction
as the College <span class="locked">proper.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></span></p>

<p>Another feature of the policy which these conditions
illustrate and which they also further, is that of
their tending to discriminate between the right kind
of scholars and others, whose circumstances will debar
them from ever reaching the ultimate end of
higher culture. Where circumstances are not propitious,
neither is the culture altogether desirable. For
what is more injurious to society at large than to have
young people hurt in two ways, positively and negatively;
positively, by placing them in a false environment
of culture, which cannot be theirs in future life;
negatively, by taking up with such culture all the
time and labor which might usefully be spent in receiving
a plainer education, and reach its term in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
commonest walk of life? Besides, the liberal education
itself suffers prejudice; for it is misinterpreted;
since it comes to be estimated then by results and by
circumstances which do not appertain to it. Every
system should be set on its own basis, and be built
up subject to its own conditions. The absoluteness
of Loyola's Constitution throughout, and of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio
Studiorum</i> in particular, throws this policy into relief
at every turn.</p>

<p>After the boy's admission into a class, he advances
thenceforward, either with the whole class, at the
general and solemn promotion every year, or, if he
excels, as the reports and the Master will determine,
he is not to be detained in that grade, but may ascend,
at any time of the year, after a fitting examination.
A number of conditions, hard to realize, make this
special promotion barely possible from the grade of
First Grammar to Humanity, or from Humanity to
<span class="locked">Rhetoric.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></span> On the other hand, "if any one is found
to be utterly incapable of entering the next grade, no
account is to be taken of any petitions."</p>

<p>2. In the philosophical and theological courses,
both of which terminate in the conferring of degrees,
the system of examinations for all students, who are
not members of the Society, refers only to those
degrees, at the time when application is made for
them. For the philosophical degree, the first preliminary
is an hour's disputation with three examiners,
on the matter of the whole course, and that in presence
of the other students. The result being satisfactory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
permission will then be granted to prepare
for a public defence of all Philosophy. This is the
method for the solemn form of graduation, which, in
the old style, confers upon the successful student,
after three years of Natural Sciences, or Philosophy,
the title of Master of Arts.</p>

<p>At this point start the three professional lines of
Medicine, Jurisprudence, Theology. The last-named
faculty ends in much the same manner as that of
Philosophy, but with a much greater amplitude of
public acts or defence, and then finally with a defence
of all Philosophy and Theology together. This entitles
the defendant to the degree of Doctor of Divinity,
which is conferred in the most solemn manner.</p>

<p>There is a pedagogical history connected with the
present subject, which it may be well to sketch in two
stages, first, that of the sixteenth century, and
secondly, that of the nineteenth.</p>

<p>Ignatius of Loyola had legislated in his Constitution
to this effect: "In the study of Arts, courses
shall be arranged in which the Natural Sciences shall
be taught; and, for these, less than three years will
not suffice; besides which, another half-year shall be
assigned the students, for repeating the matters they
have heard, for holding public acts of defence, and
for receiving the degree of Master. The whole
course, therefore, shall be three years and a half, up
to the reception of the <span class="locked">degree."<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></span> Again, Ignatius had
legislated for Divinity: "The course of Theology
shall be six years in length; all the matters that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
to be read will be treated in the first four; in the
other two, besides making a repetition, those who are
to be promoted to the degree of Doctor will make the
usual acts of <span class="locked">defence."<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></span></p>

<p>Having this legislation before them, with the experience
of forty years to illustrate its working, the
critics of 1586 are confronted, at the same time, with
a set of historical facts, which seem not to be in harmony
with the legislation. While Loyola's system
was obviously the organization of education, the
facts, which they notice, show a concomitant process
going on, in an inverse sense, towards the dissolution
of system. This, no doubt, was owing to the
disturbed condition of the sixteenth century. Making
an effort to bring the <i>Ratio</i> and the facts more
into harmony, the critics reason in this <span class="locked">manner:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>"It is hard to expect everywhere that external students
will be content to hold their acts of public
defence, only after their course of Philosophy or
Theology; and that, during the half-year, or the two
years specified beyond. For, in Italy, scarcely any
are promoted to the degrees by our faculties, except
our own alumni, or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">convictores</i>, who cannot wait so
long as that in expectancy, and who will readily slip
away to Medicine or Jurisprudence; nay, they are
alienated from us, and are offended at this severity,
seeing that, in the other universities of Italy, they
can most easily obtain the degree if they want it.
In Germany, too, such intervals of protracted waiting
are scarcely tolerated; and they rather think they
have done something, if they have gone through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
four-year course in Theology. And it would seem
proper to grant them a relaxation there; otherwise,
the men are deterred from seeking the Doctorate; so
that Germany will have but few Catholic Doctors in
the future; whereas, it abounds in non-catholic Doctors,
whose promotion is to be had any day. In
France, too, the philosophers do not wait beyond
the close of the triennium to be made Masters of
Arts; they could not put up with delay, for they are
hurrying on to Law. The same is the condition of
things with the German philosophers, for other
reasons. Therefore the Reverend Father General
might consider whether he will dispense with the
observance of the Constitution in the Italian and
Transalpine Provinces; the more so, as the Constitution
itself says that it is to be observed, as far as
may <span class="locked">be."<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></span></p>

<p>In accordance with this, the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i> is not
absolute in its general legislation, and leaves room for
the special conditions of different countries. A most
distinct conception of the meaning and process of conferring
degrees may be had, by consulting the typical
constitution of an exclusively Jesuit university, as
exhibited in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Monumenta Germaniæ Pædagogica</i>.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a>
The third part of this document treats exclusively of
the "Variety of Academic Degrees and the Conditions
for Each." And it begins by saying: "As it is expedient
to confer Academic degrees on those who are
found worthy of the same, so the utmost caution is to
be practised, lest, at any time, they be conferred on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
such as would only bring the name of the Academy
into discredit, and the degrees themselves into contempt.
Wherefore no degree is ever to be conferred
upon any one, who has not undergone all the tests
which the customs of universities require."</p>

<p>Passing on from the sixteenth century to our time,
an important gap has to be crossed in the educational
history of the Order. It is that of the Suppression,
during about forty years at the end of the last century
and the beginning of the present. These blank pages
signify the total loss of property and position, with
a severance in many places of the educational traditions
for almost sixty years, and the entire destruction
of them in many other parts. Besides, like
"goods derelict," the whole system of education which,
by means of the Society, had passed out of a limited
number of mediæval universities, and had been accommodated
with a home gratuitously in over seven
hundred cities and towns of a dozen nationalities,
was found by the Order, at its resurrection, to be
largely in the hands of State authorities, or, at least,
not independent of State control. Restored, but having
had to struggle into existence, under altered and
unfavorable circumstances, this pedagogical system
may be viewed with interest, as it stands towards the
close of the nineteenth century. For this purpose
I may be allowed to glance at it, in several parts of
the world, under the precise aspect which I have just
been regarding, that of endeavoring to complete its
work of education with Academic degrees.</p>

<p>In the United States, it has the same freedom of
action as any other system of higher education, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
none of the special support which is given to organizations
endowed by the State.</p>

<p>In many parts of the continent of Europe, the
property of the Order is in an habitual or chronic
state of confiscation, and the members, as educators,
are legally outlawed. Education can scarcely thrive
when on the wing.</p>

<p>In Austria, where the Society is fully recognized,
its teachers are, by a cross-move, practically debarred
from State recognition. To pass on their students
for State degrees, it is required that they themselves
be certified State teachers. To become such teachers,
they must have followed in actual attendance, and
during four years, the special course of Grammar,
History, etc., in which their certificate afterwards
will be recognized. Meanwhile, as Jesuits, they
have gone through the courses which I have sketched
in the pages of this essay; and they are certainly, by
this time, not to be confounded with young persons,
who are merely prospecting some limited field of
pedagogic activity, as the scope of their lives. Hence,
at this most energetic and ripe period of their lives,
they must waste four years, as if they were young
normal scholars, in following out some one or two
lines of pedagogical formation; and that, merely to
have their word admitted when they pass their students
on for the State degrees.</p>

<p>In Great Britain and the dependencies of the British
Empire there are no such harassing restrictions.
The conditions for matriculation, and for the subsequent
series of examinations, in such universities as
those of London, Calcutta, or Laval, are quite in keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
with the American ideas of social liberality;
however high and exacting otherwise may be the
standard requisite for success, either in the pass-examinations
or in the Honors. Nor, if special
matriculation is again required in certain English
universities, before entering their courses of Medicine,
does that impose any special hardship. Hence, St.
Francis Xavier's, Calcutta, ranks among the highest
of what are called the "Christian schools" of India.
To make matters clearer, I shall take two instances,
one from Great Britain itself, the other from the
Dominion of Canada.</p>

<p>Stonyhurst will illustrate the working of the State
system, as coming in contact with the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>.
The matriculation examinations at the London
University create no special difficulty, although the
higher classes of the literary curriculum may be regarded
as under a strain, in the double effort to
satisfy the <i>Ratio</i>, and to matriculate at that university.
After matriculation, the process is considerably
smoother. To take the classical or mathematical
Honors, in the B.&nbsp;A. or M.&nbsp;A. examinations, is
altogether in harmony with the usual course of the
Jesuit system. At once, after the B.&nbsp;A. Honors, a
good place on the Indian Civil Service list is within
easy reach. And, in general, changes made by the
Civil Service Commissioners have all been in the direction
of adapting their competitive examinations to
the ordinary school curriculum. In preparation for
the military academies of Woolwich and Sandhurst,
students follow the regular school course at Stonyhurst,
to within two years or so of the time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
entrance; and then they merely take up their special
course, designed for the military cadetship. The
same is now possible with regard to the navy, since
the age for entering that service has been somewhat
raised. And, to mention one of the courses
which are altogether proper to the Jesuit system, that
of Philosophy, the usual lectures of the two years'
philosophical curriculum have only to be supplemented
with a few special lectures, and the students
are ready for the philosophical papers of the B.&nbsp;A.
examination, in the London University.</p>

<p>Montreal exhibits the relations of Jesuit and State
systems in a Catholic country. The University of
Laval is at the same time chartered by the State and
by the Pope. The Jesuit Professors in the College
at Montreal conduct their own studies, examine their
students, and merely send them with certificates to
receive degrees at the University.</p>

<p>From this history it appears, that, though the curriculum
of Divinity in the Jesuit system need have
undergone no great change during three centuries,
beyond the usual self-accommodation of the courses
to new and pressing questions, its curriculum of
Philosophy has been materially affected, with reference
to the general world of students. This, as foreseen
in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i> of 1586, and as referred
to again in the revised <i>Ratio</i> of 1832, causes a double
arrangement to be made. First, wherever members
of the Order are pursuing their studies, the philosophical
triennium is, as a matter of course, in full
operation, and is prolonged with individuals into a
fourth year, for reviewing the subjects and prosecuting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
them further; and this seminary course, if connected
with a public college, remains open as ever to
the outside world. Secondly, to meet the requirements
of external students, who do not desire the full
triennium, the Provincial "will see that a course of
Philosophy be established according to the customs
and necessities of the <span class="locked">country."<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></span> Hence a biennium,
or two-year course, is commonly established; and, according
to the needs or desires of the locality, it is
conducted either in Latin or in the vernacular.</p>

<p>3. Now we may review succinctly the different
courses as conducted by the year, and as distributed
through the week.</p>

<h3>THE LITERARY CURRICULUM.</h3>

<p>The grading is based upon the principles of a classical
education. Other branches enter a classical
course, as completing the staple studies. But, on
their own merits, they receive a special distribution
of their own. The Prefect of the lower studies is
instructed to "distribute History, Geography, the elements
of Mathematics, and whatever else is usually
treated in these classes, in such a manner that each
Master can satisfactorily and conveniently finish the
matter assigned to him." This is to be done "after
consulting the Provincial authority," which assures
stability in the manner of organizing these <span class="locked">branches.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></span>
As to the mother tongue, the study of which is bound
up intimately with the classic literatures, a general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
direction is given once for all to the Professors of
these grades: "In learning the mother tongue, very
much the same method will be followed as in the
study of Latin." And, in the form of prelection to be
used, they are to adopt the method specified as peculiar
to the historian and the poet, which is more summary
than the prelection of the central prose author:
"Much the same method will be followed in giving
the prelection on classic authors in the <span class="locked">vernacular."<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Lower Grammar.</span> The grade of this class is the
perfect knowledge of the rudiments, and an incipient
knowledge of syntax. In Greek: reading, writing,
and a certain portion of the grammar. The authors
used for prelection will be some easy selections from
Cicero, besides fables of Phædrus and lives of Nepos.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Middle Grammar.</span> The grade is the knowledge,
though not entire, of all grammar; another portion of
the Greek grammar; and, for the prelection, only the
select epistles, narrations, descriptions, and the like
from Cicero, with the Commentaries of Cæsar, and
some of the easiest poems of Ovid. In Greek: the
fables of Æsop, select and expurgated dialogues of
Lucian, the Table of Cebes.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Upper Grammar.</span> The grade is the complete
knowledge of grammar, including all the exceptions
and idioms in syntax, figures of rhetoric, and the art
of versification. In Greek: the eight parts of speech,
or all the rudiments. For the lessons: in prose, the
most difficult epistles of Cicero, the books De Amicitia,
De Senectute, and others of the kind, or even some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
the easier orations; in poetry, some select elegies and
epistles of Ovid, also selections from Catullus, Tibullus,
Propertius, and the eclogues of Virgil, or some
of Virgil's easier books. In Greek: St. Chrysostom,
Xenophon, and the like.</p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Humanity.</span> The grade is to prepare, as it were,
the ground for eloquence, which is done in three
ways, by a knowledge of the language, some erudition,
and a sketch of the precepts pertaining to Rhetoric.
For a command of the language, which consists
chiefly in acquiring propriety of expression and
fluency, the one prose author employed in daily prelections
is Cicero; as historical writers, Cæsar, Sallust,
Livy, Curtius, and others of the kind; the poets
used are, first of all, Virgil; also select odes of Horace,
with the elegies, epigrams, and other productions of
illustrious poets, expurgated; in like manner, orators,
historians, and poets, in the vernacular. The erudition
conveyed should be slight, and only to stimulate
and recreate the mind, not to impede progress in
learning the tongue. The precepts will be the general
rules of expression and style, and the special rules on
the minor kinds of composition, epistles, narrations,
descriptions, both in verse and prose. In Greek: the
art of versification, and some notions of the dialects;
also a clear understanding of authors, and some composition
in Greek. The Greek prose authors will be
Saints Chrysostom and Basil, epistles of Plato and
Synesius, some selections from Plutarch; the poets,
Homer, Phocylides, Theognis, St. Gregory Nazianzen,
Synesius, and others like them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Rhetoric.</span> The grade of this class cannot easily
be defined. For it trains to perfect eloquence, which
comprises two great faculties, the oratorical and
poetical, the former chiefly being the object of culture;
nor does it regard only the practical, but the
beautiful also. For the precepts, Cicero may be supplemented
with Quintilian and Aristotle. The style,
which may be assisted by drawing on the most approved
historians and poets, is to be formed on Cicero;
all of his works are most fitted for this purpose, but
only his speeches should be made the subject of prelection,
that the precepts of the art may be seen in practice.
As to the vernacular, the style should be formed
on the best authors. The erudition will be derived
from the history and manners of nations, from the
authority of writers and all learning; but moderately,
as befits the capacity of the students. In Greek, the
fuller knowledge of authors and of dialects is to be
acquired. The Greek authors, whether orators, historians,
or poets, are to be ancient and classic:
Demosthenes, Plato, Thucydides, Homer, Hesiod,
Pindar, and others of the kind, including Saints
Nazianzen, Basil, and Chrysostom.</p>

<p>The compilers of the preliminary <i>Ratio</i> throw out
some very useful hints, relative to the work and scope
of this class. They say, for instance, that the students
of Rhetoric "are to be assisted with almost a
daily exposition of some poet, to derive thence the
variety and richness of poetic imitation and diction."
Again, "nothing dialectic is to be made the subject of
prelection in this class, since rhetoricians are to be
kept as far away as possible from the style, invention,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
and spirit of dialectics." "Two or three years" are
spoken of as spent in this <span class="locked">grade.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></span> At any rate, "all
our day-scholars or <span class="locked">boarders<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></span> should spend one year
in Rhetoric before they enter on Philosophy; this
should be brought home to their parents. The others,
who attend our courses from <span class="locked">outside,<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></span> should be persuaded
to do the <span class="locked">same."<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></span> If they still insist upon
entering the philosophical curriculum at too early an
age, special means are suggested to discountenance
such a practice.</p>

<p>All these five grades are evidently so connected as
not to overlap one another. Neither are they to be
multiplied, except in the sense of allowing more than
a single division, when scholars are very numerous.
If all the grades cannot be maintained in any place,
"the higher ones, as far as possible, are to be kept,
the lower being dispensed <span class="locked">with."<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></span></p>

<h3>THE PHILOSOPHICAL CURRICULUM.</h3>

<p>With the side branches sufficiently learned, with the
boy's native talents "stimulated" or "cultivated," as
the <i>Ratio</i> frequently expresses <span class="locked">itself,<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></span> and his memory
enriched with the fullest materials for style in two
languages, Latin and the vernacular, while Greek has
subsidized his culture, the student enters on the study
of Philosophy, using scholastic Latin as the vehicle
of expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
This instrument for the expression of philosophical
thought possesses the qualities of subtlety, keenness,
and precision, which the dialectic practice of all universities
had tended to develop in it, from the twelfth
century onwards. With the addition of Cicero's fulness
and richness, which the colleges cultivated with
so much ardor, the scholastic Latin of men like Molina,
Ripalda, Liberatore, Franzelin, and so many others,
has flourished to a degree of literary excellence.</p>

<p>Mathematics runs parallel with the course of Philosophy,
and upon that branch of science there is a
rather eloquent passage in the <i>Ratio</i> of <span class="locked">1586.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></span> Physics
was always included in the Aristotelian philosophy.
The career of Modern Physics was then in the
future. But, as in Mathematics pure and applied,
the courses were always advanced to the foremost
rank, and in Arithmetic and Geometry we notice that,
as early as 1667, a single public course, under the
direction of Jesuits at Caen, numbered four hundred
<span class="locked">students,<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></span> so, in the middle of the next century, the
eighteenth, we find physical cabinets in regular use,
and experimental lectures given to the classes by the
Professors of <span class="locked">Physics.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></span> The basis of the study is
thus laid down in the rules of the revised <i>Ratio</i>:
"The Professor is to expose theories, systems, and
hypotheses, so as to make it clear what degree of certitude
or probability belongs to each. Since this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
faculty makes new progress every day, the Professor
must consider it part of his duty to know the more
recent discoveries, so that in his prelections he may
advance with the science <span class="locked">itself."<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></span> The general assemblies
had legislated on this subject, as I indicated
before; assigning its proper place in Philosophy to
what they called "the more pleasant" or the "lighter"
form of Physics. Indeed, Philosophy itself in the
course of three centuries came to feel many new needs
and submitted to new lines of treatment.</p>

<p><b>First Year.</b> <span class="smcap">Logic and General Metaphysics.</span>
<i>One Professor: eight hours a week.</i> Introductory
sketch of Philosophy. Dialectics or Minor Logic:
ideas, judgment, reasoning. Logic Proper: The criteria
of truth; species of knowledge, and general
rules of criticism and hermeneutics. General Metaphysics
or Ontology: The notions of being and the
categories. <span class="smcap">Mathematics.</span> <i>One Professor: six hours
a week.</i> All that prepares for the Physics of the following
year, viz., algebra, geometry, plane and spherical
trigonometry, and conic sections. This rapid
course, in so short a time, supposes that the matter
is not entirely new, but has been studied already in
the literary course.</p>

<p><b>Second Year and part of the Third.</b> <span class="smcap">Special Metaphysics.</span>
<i>One Professor: four hours a week.</i> First,
Cosmology: The origin of the world, the elements of
bodies, the perfection of the world, its nature and
laws, supernatural effects and their criteria, as
examined by philosophical principles. Secondly,
Psychology: The essence of the human soul, and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
faculties: sensation, imagination, memory, the nature
of intelligence and reason, appetite, will, freedom;
the essential difference between soul and body; the
simplicity, spirituality, and immortality of the soul;
the union of soul and body, the nature and origin of
ideas; the vital principle of brutes. Thirdly, Natural
Theology: God, His existence and attributes,
etc., as viewed by the light of human reason. <span class="smcap">Physics.</span>
<i>One Professor: nine hours a week.</i> Mechanics,
dynamics; the properties of bodies, hydrostatics,
hydraulics, aerostatics, pneumatics; the elements
of astronomy; light, caloric, electricity, magnetism,
meteorology. What is not completed in this year is
continued in the next, with the elements of natural
history. Much of this course may have been seen in
the literary curriculum. "The matters are not to
be treated so exclusively from a rational standpoint,
as to leave barely any time for experiments; nor are
experiments so to occupy the time, that it looks like a
merely experimental science." <span class="smcap">Chemistry.</span> <i>One Professor:
three hours a week.</i> Inorganic and organic.</p>

<p><b>Third Year.</b> <span class="smcap">Metaphysics.</span> <i>One Professor: four
hours a week.</i> What remains of the course just described,
under the second year. <span class="smcap">Moral Philosophy.</span>
<i>One Professor: four hours a week.</i> The end of man,
the morality of human actions, natural law, natural
rights and duties; the principles of public right.
<span class="smcap">Physics.</span> <i>One Professor: two hours a week.</i> Geology,
astronomy, physiology. Part of the course above
can be reserved for this year. <span class="smcap">Mathematics.</span> <i>One
Professor: three hours a week.</i> Analytical geometry
and differential calculus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
In these courses of Natural Science, if the matter is
not altogether new, as having been studied in the
lower faculties, the philosophical attitude of theoretic
criticism is quite specific throughout this curriculum.</p>

<h3>THE THEOLOGICAL CURRICULUM.</h3>

<p>As the Jesuit theologians of Cologne announced in
their programme of 1578 that, while they followed
St. Thomas, yet "neither all the matters, nor those
alone which he treated," were to be handled by them;
so, in every age, the standard adopted has been adhered
to, with the same practical eye to the needs of
the times. The reason is the same as those theologians
assigned; because, they said, "Every age has
definite fields of conflict, which render it necessary
that Theology be enlarged with a variety of newly
disputed questions, and, in fact, that it assume a new
<span class="locked">form."<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></span> In the arrangement of Scholastic Theology
the <i>Ratio</i> suggests the following <span class="locked">form:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><b>Scholastic Theology.</b> <span class="smcap">Four Years.</span> <i>Two Professors:
each four hours a week.</i> <i>One course.</i> Religion
and the Church; God in Unity and Trinity; His
attributes, predestination: God as Creator; the Angels;
the creation of Man and his fall; the Incarnation;
Three of the Seven Sacraments. <i>The other
course.</i> Human acts, virtues, and vices; the theological
virtues; the cardinal virtues; right and justice;
religion; grace; the Sacraments in general; the rest
of the Seven Sacraments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
<b>Moral Theology.</b> <span class="smcap">Two years.</span> <i>One Professor:
five and a half hours a week.</i> The scope of this course
is to form Ministers of the Sacraments. <i>One year.</i>
Human acts, conscience, laws, sins, the Commandments,
excepting the seventh. <i>The other year.</i> The
seventh Commandment, which includes contracts; the
Sacraments, censures, the states and duties of life.</p>

<p><b>Ecclesiastical History.</b> <span class="smcap">Two Years.</span> <i>One Professor:
two hours a week.</i> The questions, necessary and opportune,
in the history of each century.</p>

<p><b>Canon Law.</b> <span class="smcap">Two Years.</span> <i>One Professor: two
hours a week.</i> <i>One year.</i> Persons, judgments, penalties.
<i>The other year.</i> Things.</p>

<p><b>Sacred Scripture.</b> <span class="smcap">Two Years.</span> <i>One Professor:
four hours a week.</i> General prolegomena. A book
from the Old and New Testament alternately.</p>

<p><b>Hebrew.</b> <span class="smcap">One Year.</span> <i>One Professor: two hours a
week.</i> Supplemented with one hour a week on Syriac,
Arabic, Chaldaic, during four years.</p>

<h3>GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF TIME.</h3>

<p>The compilers of the preliminary <i>Ratio</i> made an
effort to draw up a uniform system for the distribution
of time in the various countries. But the final
<i>Ratio</i> preferred to leave the matter thus: "Since the
variety of countries, times, and persons is apt to introduce
variety in the order to be observed, and in the
distribution of hours for study, repetitions, disputations,
and other exercises, as also in vacations, the
proper authority will report to the General whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
he thinks more expedient in his Province, for the
better advancement of studies, that a definite arrangement
may be come to, which will meet all exigencies;
keeping, however, as near as possible to the common
order of our <span class="locked">studies."<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></span> Accordingly, a rule of the
General Prefect of Studies prescribes that "he lay
down not only an order of studies, repetitions, disputations
to be observed by members of the Society, by
our scholars, and by external students at large, under
the direction of their Professors; but also that he
distribute all their time, to the effect that they spend
the hours of private study <span class="locked">well."<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></span></p>

<p>I shall give three sketches of actual arrangements
for the conduct of the literary or secondary curriculum;
and one normal arrangement for the two departments
of superior education in Philosophy and
Theology. The three schedules for the secondary
course are taken from the English speaking world.
That numbered (I), if presented in full, would read
very much like the usual arrangement of an American
college. It is the method more or less adopted
by the Jesuit colleges which centre around the St.
Louis University in the Western States. The schedule
numbered (II) represents the system of Georgetown
College, and of others in the Eastern States; it
looks like a close adaptation of the system as presented
in these pages. Number (III) is the method
of Stonyhurst College, England; and to it may be
referred the Canadian system, and that of Hindustan.
The hours indicated in this schedule include the set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
time for studies, besides the hours of class. The set
study time, in a boarding college, may be taken to
average four and a half hours a day; other hours may
be added thereto, from free study time, or hours of
superfluous recreation. The Stonyhurst arrangement
is interesting, as being that of a faculty two hundred
and ninety-nine years old, without any intermission
in its career. Its original home was St. Omer's,
France, where Father Parsons founded the college
in 1592. At the suppression of the Order in France,
1762, the college moved to Bruges in Belgium; thence,
in 1773, to Liége; whence, under the stress of the
French Revolution, it took refuge in England, and
opened its courses at Stonyhurst, Lancashire, in 1794.</p>

<p>The schedule for the philosophical triennium (Superior
Instruction, B) is taken from Woodstock
College and St. Louis University; that of the theological
course (Superior Instruction, C) from Woodstock.
In these schedules, as well as in that not
exhibited here for the seminary course of Literature
(Superior Instruction, A), no material difference would
be found to exist between one house of studies and
another in the Society.</p>

<span class="subhead">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>

<p>It will not have escaped the attentive reader, that
almost all the history, pedagogic or otherwise, which
has been sketched in this essay, falls within the lines
of what has been called the Counter-Reformation;
and some portion of it belongs to what is styled, in
the present century, the Counter-Revolution. For
this reason, if the facts recorded seem at all new, he
will discern the reason. They have lain outside of
one of the beaten paths in history.</p>

<p>Beyond the facts of evolution, as they may have
appeared in these pages, I do not pretend to have
found a place for this system in any plan of pedagogic
development. Nor do I lay claim to the far-sightedness
which may discern any posthumous development,
as the legacy of this system to the world of education.
Politically, its place has often been assigned to it
summarily by main force. But, pedagogically, too,
the day may come, when gathered to the other remains
which moulder in the past, it can look down
from a grade and place of its own in evolution, and
look out, like others, on a progeny more favored than
itself, the fair mother of fairer children; even as the
old university system of mediæval Europe, particularly
that of the great University of Paris, can look down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
from its silent and solemn place in history, as the
direct progenitor of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>. "We, too,
have been taught by others," said Possevino in 1592.
Indeed, as is evident, the last thing which the system
ever seems to dream of, which never, in fact, crosses
the path of its intellectual vision, is that it is playing
the rôle, perchance, of a pedagogic adventurer, or
courting notice by some new and striking departure.
No doubt, in its integrity, it is singularly the system
of the Jesuits, and, in a multitude of practical elements,
it embodies the elaborate experience of one
practical organization of men. But, none the less, if
we look down for its foundations, we pass through
the Renaissance of Letters, and find the traditions of
scholastic Europe; and further down still, in the
stratification of history, we come to the principles of
education as defined by Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates.</p>

<p>As to its ulterior evolution, I may designate two
forms which the system has been invited to assume.
Rather, I may point to an epoch in its
history, at which general and universal education
divided off into two lines; and, by one or other way,
almost all the secondary and superior education,
which prevails amongst us, reaches our present time.
The principles adopted on one side, however extravagant
they may have been at their first adoption and
in all the glow and fervor of a new departure, will
certainly recommend themselves to some. The other
was practically, if it has not as yet been formally,
adopted by the Order as a continuation of its old
method, and as a revision in the nineteenth century
of what itself had laid down in the fifteenth. I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
quote, to explain one of the movements, a writer,
M. Drevon, whom I cited once <span class="locked">before,<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></span> chiefly because
he is quite recent, and also because he is entirely out
of sympathy with the system of the Jesuits. For
the other, I will quote one of the latest Generals of
the Society of Jesus, Father John Roothaan.</p>

<p>When the Jesuit colleges, more than ninety in
number, were abruptly closed in France, then, says
the first writer, "the departure of the Jesuits was
the occasion of a noisy demonstration against the
instruction which had been imparted in the colleges.
A multitude of <span class="locked">books<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></span> were at once seen pouring into
the market, presenting plans for a new system of
education, which should be more in keeping with the
progress of Science and Philosophy. Men of the
gravest authority, like the President Roland, did not
disdain to occupy themselves with these matters, and
to enter into details: 'The moment was come,' cried
one of them, 'to set up furnaces, to add bellows
thereto, and initiate scholars into the doctrine of
<span class="locked">gases.'<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></span> The reaction was so much the more violent,
as spirits had been the longer suppressed. It went
even beyond the just measure, as happens almost
always in such circumstances; so that, says a contemporary
<span class="locked">writer,<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></span> children, properly instructed, ought to
have become, at the age of fifteen, agriculturists sufficiently
well qualified, intelligent naturalists, prudent
economists, shrewd business men, enlightened
politicians, profound metaphysicians, prodigious geometricians,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
without prejudice to writing and drawing,
to universal geography, and ancient as well as modern
history; without prejudice to the French language,
English also and German and a little Latin; and again
without prejudice to music and heraldry, to dancing
and fencing, to horsemanship, and, above all, to swimming.
But people had not long to wait before deploring
such excess. All this agitation proved unfortunately
sterile; and as I have just said, on the eve of
the French Revolution, secondary education had not
taken a step forward during fifty years....</p>

<p>"It came to a new birth in 1808, and found itself
very much where it had been, before this long sleep.
Napoleon declared that the new method of the University
was very like that of the ancient University
of Paris; only that the courses 'left something to
desire with regard to drawing, modern languages,
geography, history, and especially mathematical and
physical sciences.' This was progress, no doubt, and
it is well to grant it. But Napoleon is mistaken,
when he pretends that the new University is a child
of the ancient one. It is preëminently a child of
the Jesuits. For, as we have remarked, the Jesuits,
at the beginning, took great care to make no innovations.
They accepted, as they found them, the old
methods, introduced little by little their own mode of
procedure, an alteration most calculated to assure
their influence and their success. The grand old
University which went down to the second rank, so
to say, in public education, submitted to the influence
of its detested and triumphant rivals, and, in spite of
itself, it allowed itself to be permeated by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
methods. Hence, in 1808, at the moment when
Napoleon dreams that he is reëstablishing the University,
the ideal of public instruction was a mixture
of the old university traditions and the empiric
methods of the <span class="locked">Jesuits."<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></span></p>

<p>It does not come within the scope of this writer to
indicate how, from this historical point of divergence,
the modern practical method of instruction came to
be fully organized. Each system went its own way.
I pass on to the other line, or rather back to the Jesuit
<i>Ratio</i>; and I will merely point out what process of
adjustment it then underwent.</p>

<p>In 1832, Father Roothaan, General of the Society,
addressed an encyclical letter to the Order. To give
an abstract of it, he says: "In the very first assembly
after the restoration of the Society, a petition had
been received from the Provinces, and daily experience
since then has shown it to be more and more
necessary, that the System of Studies should be accommodated
to the exigencies of the times. After a consultation,
involving much labor and accurate study, a
form of revised <i>Ratio</i> has been drawn up, which is now
offered for use and practice, in order that after being
amended again if necessary, or else enlarged, it may
receive the sanction of a universal law. The undertaking
was approached with the greatest reverence
for a System which had been approved by two centuries
of successful operation, and which had been
extolled, not unfrequently, by the very enemies of
the Order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
"Of the novelties which had been introduced into
the method of educating youth, during the last fifty
years or more, was it forsooth possible that all could
be approved and adopted in our schools? New
methods and new forms invented day after day, a
new arrangement of matter and of time, often self-contradictory
and mutually repugnant&mdash;how could
all this be taken as a rule for our studies?</p>

<p>"In the higher schools or in the treatment of the
graver studies, it is a subject of lamentation with prudent
men that there is no solidity but much show,&mdash;an
ill-arranged mass of superfluous knowledge, very
little exact reasoning&mdash;; that the sciences, if you except
Physics and Mathematics, have not made any true
progress, but are in general confusion, so that where
the final results of truth are to be found scarcely appears.
The study of Logic and severe Dialectics is
almost in contempt, whence errors come to be deeply
rooted in the minds of men who are not otherwise
illiterate; and these errors, by some fatality or other,
are made much of, as if they were ascertained truths,
and they are lauded to the skies, because nothing is
treated with strictness and accuracy, no account is
made of definitions and distinctness of reasoning.
Thus, tasting lightly of philosophical matters, young
men go forth utterly defenceless against sophistry,
since they cannot even see the difference between a
sophism and an argument.</p>

<p>"In the lower schools, the object kept in view is to
have boys learn as many things as possible, and learn
them in the shortest time, and with the least exertion
possible. Excellent! But that variety of so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
many things and so many courses, all lightly sipped
of by youth, enables them to conceive a high opinion
of how much they know, and sometimes swells the
crowd of the half-instructed, the most pernicious of
all classes to the Sciences and the State alike. As to
knowing anything truly and solidly, there is none of
it. Something of everything: nothing in the <span class="locked">end.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a></span>
Running through the courses of letters in no time,
tender in age, with minds as yet untrained, they take
up the gravest studies of Philosophy and the Higher
Sciences; and, possessing themselves therein of
scarcely any real fruit, they are only captivated by
the enjoyment of greater liberty; they run headlong
into vice, and are soon to become teachers themselves
of a type, which, to put it as gently as possible, I
will call immature.</p>

<p>"As to the methods, ever easier and easier, which
are being excogitated, whatever convenience may be
found in them, there is this grave inconvenience;
first, that what is acquired without labor adheres but
lightly to the mind, and what is summarily gathered
in is summarily forgotten; secondly, and this, though
not adverted to by many, is a much more serious injury,
almost the principal fruit of a boy's training is
sacrificed, which is, accustoming himself from an
early age to serious application of mind, and to
that deliberate exertion which is required for hard
work.</p>

<p>"In some points, however, which do not concern the
substance of education, the necessities of our times
require us to modify the practice of our predecessors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
And to consult the requirements of such necessities,
far from being alien to our principles, is altogether
in keeping with the Institute.</p>

<p>"In the superior courses, how many questions are
there which formerly never entered into controversy,
which now are vehemently assaulted, and must be
established by solid arguments, lest the very foundations
of truth be sapped! Therefore the questions
which are alive call for special discussion, solution,
refutation.</p>

<p>"In Physics and Mathematics we must not prove
false to the traditions of the Society, by neglecting
these courses which have now mounted to a rank of
the highest honor. If many have abused these
sciences to the detriment of religion, we should be
so much the farther from relinquishing them on that
account. Rather, on that account, should the members
of the Order apply themselves with the more
ardor to these pursuits and snatch the weapons from
the hands of the foe, and with the same arms, which
they abuse to attack the truth, come forward in its
defence. For truth is always consistent with itself,
and in all the sciences it stands erect, ever one and
the same; nor is it possible that what is true in Physics
and Mathematics should contradict truth of a
higher order.</p>

<p>"Finally, in the method of conducting the lower
studies, some accessory branches should have time
provided for them, especially the vernacular tongues
and literatures. But the study of Latin and Greek
letters must always remain intact and be the chief
object of attention. As they have always been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
principal sources, exhibiting the most perfect models
of literary beauty in precept and style, so are they
still. And, if they were kept more before the eyes
and mind, we should not see issuing from the press,
day after day, so many productions of talented men,
with a diction and style no less novel and singular,
than are the thoughts and opinions to which they
give expression. The commonalty regard them with
admiring awe and stupor; but men of knowledge and
correct taste look with commiseration and grief on
these unmistakable signs of an eloquence, no less depraved
than the morals of the times.</p>

<p>"The adaptation of the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>, therefore,
means that we consult the necessities of the age so
far as not in the least to sacrifice the solid and correct
education of <span class="locked">youth."<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></span></p>

<p>This is the substance of a document not unworthy
of the letters and ordinances in behalf of education,
issued by a long line of experienced and learned
judges in the art of training youth. The modifications
made in the old <i>Ratio</i> have been few; and I
have taken note of them in the preceding analysis.</p>

<p>So then the edifice of the past stands, with the
latest modifications introduced into its façade by the
spirit of the present. As the monumental structures
which stud the soil of Europe, and are set amid
royal parks or rich fields of waving grain, have been
tributes of devotion from princes of the church or
princes of the land, and are not only the memorials
of kings or peoples, but are especially the architectural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
record of centuries; so a system recognized in
history as great, elevated in the order of highest
human achievement, that of educating humanity, and
resting on the basis of oldest traditions and the wisdom
of the remotest past, has not been the work of an
ordinary individual, nor of a day. Masters in their
art, and centuries in their duration, have combined to
build it up, a monument of the practice and theory of
generations. With devoted zeal and prudence, secular
communities, and even pagans in times far gone
by, had brought the stones, and contributed tithes to
the erection of the fabric. But it is only too well
known that Ecclesiastics and Religious men have
been the architects of the monument as it stands.
And they did not build better than they knew; for
their structure is precisely one of knowledge, chiefly
of divine knowledge, raised into a consistent theory,
and honored by the most practical use. So the
very first sentence in the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ratio Studiorum</i>, speaking
of the "abundant practical fruit to be gathered
from this manifold labor of the schools," mentions
that fruit as being "the knowledge and love of the
Creator."</p>

<p>I may be permitted then to close this work by
quoting their own poetry, which is inscribed on a
statue of Christ. The statue overlooks a park in
front of it, and the fields hard by, and the rich garden
of studious youth, within the college walls alongside.
Thus one inscription <span class="locked">reads:&mdash;</span></p>
